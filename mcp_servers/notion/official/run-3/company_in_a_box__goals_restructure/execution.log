I'll help you restructure the Current Goals section on your Company In A Box page. Let me first find the page and then examine its current structure.
| API-post-search {"query": "Company In A Box", "filter": {"property":"object","value":"page"}}
Now let me get the content of the main "Company In A Box" page to examine the current structure of the Current Goals section:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-80b1-a664-cc36b071c911"}
I need to examine the column list sections to find the Current Goals section. Let me check the first column list:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81c4-8eed-dcc609a0162d"}
Let me check the second column list which might contain the Current Goals section:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81f7-8ed5-d6f9c8add1c8"}
Let me check the first column to see if it contains the Current Goals:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8163-9c47-eb2b8834b1d8"}
Let me check the second column:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81af-ac8d-c186eb563d1b"}
Let me check the first column list's first column:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81da-93e9-ecbcae361ace"}
Now let me check the second column of the first column list:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8142-9408-e9f5706665d4"}
Perfect! I found the Current Goals section. Now I can see the structure:

1. **Current Goals** (heading_1)
2. **‚öôÔ∏è Expand Operations to LATAM** (heading_3) with paragraph description
3. **üõ†Ô∏è Push for Enterprise** (heading_3) with paragraph description
4. **ü©∂ Boost Employee Engagement** (heading_3) with paragraph description

Now I need to:
1. Add the new "üîÑ Digital Transformation Initiative" heading
2. Convert all four headings to toggles
3. Move the descriptions inside the toggles

Let me start by adding the new heading and its content after the last block:
| API-patch-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8142-9408-e9f5706665d4", "after": "2562b7e8-cebd-81d8-bbf5-f105e3ce17bc", "children": [{"type":"heading_3","heading_3":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"üîÑ Digital Transformation Initiative"}}]}},{"type":"paragraph","paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"Modernize our technology infrastructure and digitize key business processes to improve efficiency and customer experience."}}]}}]}
Now I need to convert all four headings to toggleable headings and move their descriptions inside them. I'll start with the first one - "‚öôÔ∏è Expand Operations to LATAM":
| API-update-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8179-8ed1-c992ab549e66", "type": {"heading_3":{"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"‚öôÔ∏è Expand Operations to LATAM"},"type":"text"}],"is_toggleable":true}}}
Let me try a different approach. I need to update the block properly:
| API-update-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8179-8ed1-c992ab549e66", "heading_3": {"is_toggleable":true,"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"‚öôÔ∏è Expand Operations to LATAM"},"type":"text"}]}}
Great! Now I need to move the description paragraph as a child of this toggle. Let me first delete the paragraph and then add it as a child:
| API-delete-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81c6-89a1-eb1c918cc7d0"}
Now I'll add the description as a child of the toggle:
| API-patch-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8179-8ed1-c992ab549e66", "children": [{"paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"Focus on marketing and sales efforts in Latin America."},"type":"text"}]},"type":"paragraph"}]}
Perfect! Now let me do the same for the second goal "üõ†Ô∏è Push for Enterprise":
| API-update-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8133-ad82-e896a9febfd1", "heading_3": {"is_toggleable":true,"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"üõ†Ô∏è Push for Enterprise"},"type":"text"}]}}
Now delete the description paragraph and add it as a child:
| API-delete-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-811a-95ee-c20587884a0f"}

| API-patch-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8133-ad82-e896a9febfd1", "children": [{"paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"Aim product development, marketing, and sales efforts at the enterprise segment to expand our client base."},"type":"text"}]},"type":"paragraph"}]}
Great! Now let me do the same for the third goal "ü©∂ Boost Employee Engagement":
| API-update-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-818e-8fcb-f319ede12752", "heading_3": {"is_toggleable":true,"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"ü©∂ Boost Employee Engagement"},"type":"text"}]}}
Now delete the description paragraph and add it as a child:
| API-delete-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81d8-bbf5-f105e3ce17bc"}

| API-patch-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-818e-8fcb-f319ede12752", "children": [{"paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"Aim to increase the overall employee satisfaction score by 10% in the next quarter. This will be achieved through regular feedback surveys and targeted action plans."},"type":"text"}]},"type":"paragraph"}]}
Finally, let me convert the fourth goal "üîÑ Digital Transformation Initiative" to a toggle:
| API-update-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81bd-82a8-ea6d1b979a98", "heading_3": {"is_toggleable":true,"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"üîÑ Digital Transformation Initiative"},"type":"text"}]}}
Now delete the description paragraph and add it as a child:
| API-delete-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8117-ba42-ed58f860cefb"}

| API-patch-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81bd-82a8-ea6d1b979a98", "children": [{"paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"Modernize our technology infrastructure and digitize key business processes to improve efficiency and customer experience."},"type":"text"}]},"type":"paragraph"}]}
Perfect! I have successfully restructured the **Current Goals** section on your **Company In A Box** page according to your requirements:

##‚úÖ **Task Completed Successfully**

Here's what I accomplished:

### 1. **Added New Goal Heading**
‚úÖ Created a new `heading_3` block titled "üîÑ Digital Transformation Initiative" with appropriate description

### 2. **Converted All Four Goal Headings to Toggles**
‚úÖ All four goal headings are now toggleable:
- ‚öôÔ∏è Expand Operations to LATAM  
- üõ†Ô∏è Push for Enterprise
- ü©∂ Boost Employee Engagement  
- üîÑ Digital Transformation Initiative  

### 3. **Moved Descriptions Inside Toggles**
‚úÖ Each goal's description paragraph is now nested as a child block within its respective toggle:
- **LATAM Expansion**: "Focus on marketing and sales efforts in Latin America."
- **Enterprise Push**: "Aim product development, marketing, and sales efforts at the enterprise segment to expand our client base."
- **Employee Engagement**: "Aim to increase the overall employee satisfaction score by 10% in the next quarter. This will be achieved through regular feedback surveys and targeted action plans."
- **Digital Transformation**: "Modernize our technology infrastructure and digitize key business processes to improve efficiency and customer experience."

### 4. **Preserved Content & Order**
‚úÖ All original text, formatting, and order have been maintained exactly as they were, with only the structural changes applied.

Your **Current Goals** section now features a clean, organized layout with four toggleable goal headings that users can expand to view the detailed descriptions inside. This creates a more streamlined and professional appearance while keeping all the important information easily accessible.
