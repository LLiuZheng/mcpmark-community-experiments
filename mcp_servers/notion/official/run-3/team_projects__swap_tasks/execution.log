I'll help you find the Team Projects page, analyze task assignments, and swap the tasks between the person with the most and fewest tasks. Let me start by searching for the Team Projects page.
| API-post-search {"query": "Team Projects"}
Great! I found the Team Projects page and there's a database called "Projects" that contains tasks. I can see there's also a Tasks relation property. Let me first look at the Team Projects page to understand the structure better, then query the tasks database to analyze task assignments.
| API-retrieve-a-page {"page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8092-b81d-c36a240dc77c"}
Now let me get the children blocks of this page to see what's inside, including the databases:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8092-b81d-c36a240dc77c"}
Perfect! I can see there are two databases: Projects and Tasks. The Tasks database has ID `2562b7e8-cebd-81ff-bd22-c40d5c0f0e29`. Now let me query the Tasks database to see the structure and find out who is responsible for the most and fewest tasks:
| API-retrieve-a-database {"database_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81ff-bd22-c40d5c0f0e29"}
Great! I can see the Tasks database has an "Assigned" property (ID: `M_^{`) that contains people. Now let me query all the tasks to analyze the assignments:
| API-post-database-query {"database_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81ff-bd22-c40d5c0f0e29"}
Now I need to analyze the task assignments. Let me count the tasks assigned to each person:

From the data, I can see the user IDs and count their tasks:

- `bdfdfe07-0358-4fe9-bc70-c6894e833486`: 5 tasks
- `d6d7b31c-7e3b-4a5c-afc0-71f0167f1d50`: 4 tasks  
- `5ac96c02-49a4-4320-8de6-b663ba83126b`: 3 tasks
- `ac7a3bd0-c111-4464-8f45-8a857a1abc8a`: 8 tasks
- `c2d0aa10-7c2e-41a6-8d07-62b3ee926b8e`: 4 tasks
- Unassigned tasks: 3 tasks

So:
- **Most tasks**: `ac7a3bd0-c111-4464-8f45-8a857a1abc8a` (8 tasks)
- **Fewest tasks**: `5ac96c02-49a4-4320-8de6-b663ba83126b` (3 tasks)

Let me get the user information to see their names:
| API-get-user {"user_id": "ac7a3bd0-c111-4464-8f45-8a857a1abc8a"}
Let me get the user with the fewest tasks:
| API-get-user {"user_id": "5ac96c02-49a4-4320-8de6-b663ba83126b"}
I can't retrieve user details due to permissions, but I can still proceed with the task swap. Let me identify the specific task IDs for each user:

**User `ac7a3bd0-c111-4464-8f45-8a857a1abc8a` (8 tasks - MOST):**
1. `2562b7e8-cebd-81b8-a3da-c8ba60b817fc` - "Research popular integrations"
2. `2562b7e8-cebd-8100-8f37-fe76cdd51656` - "Analyze existing onboarding data"
3. `2562b7e8-cebd-8100-a195-f0dead0d9069` - "Design and develop an interface"
4. `2562b7e8-cebd-813d-8d9e-ffac89ee50c5` - "Test the integration in production"
5. `2562b7e8-cebd-81d1-8abb-dcdb6878029a` - "Determine feature set support"
6. `2562b7e8-cebd-8157-b057-c9b1db392293` - "Test the social media integration"
7. `2562b7e8-cebd-8170-83b3-fd09de740959` - "Train support staff on best practices"
8. `2562b7e8-cebd-8191-88af-cb800460c105` - "Test the knowledge base with users"
9. `2562b7e8-cebd-8101-b4ab-f0024a9f52cc` - "Test the integration in a dev enviroment"

**User `5ac96c02-49a4-4320-8de6-b663ba83126b` (3 tasks - FEWEST):**
1. `2562b7e8-cebd-810e-b26a-ef11106c7912` - "Set up automated responses"
2. `2562b7e8-cebd-813d-b48f-f2e8e018f11c` - "Determine which topics we should cover"
3. `2562b7e8-cebd-8163-ba84-d0b2c52a117c` - "Decide which features to support"

Now I need to swap their assignments. I'll reassign:
- The8 tasks from user `ac7a3bd0-c111-4464-8f45-8a857a1abc8a` to user `5ac96c02-49a4-4320-8de6-b663ba83126b`
- The 3 tasks from user `5ac96c02-49a4-4320-8de6-b663ba83126b` to user `ac7a3bd0-c111-4464-8f45-8a857a1abc8a`

Let me start by updating the tasks. I'll update each task's "Assigned" property:
| API-patch-page {"page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81b8-a3da-c8ba60b817fc", "properties": {"Assigned":{"type":"people","people":[{"object":"user","id":"5ac96c02-49a4-4320-8de6-b663ba83126b"}]}}}
Great! Now let me continue with the rest of the tasks. I'll reassign all the tasks that were assigned to the user with the most tasks to the user with the fewest:
| API-patch-page {"page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8100-8f37-fe76cdd51656", "properties": {"Assigned":{"people":[{"id":"5ac96c02-49a4-4320-8de6-b663ba83126b","object":"user"}],"type":"people"}}}

| API-patch-page {"page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8100-a195-f0dead0d9069", "properties": {"Assigned":{"people":[{"id":"5ac96c02-49a4-4320-8de6-b663ba83126b","object":"user"}],"type":"people"}}}

| API-patch-page {"page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-813d-8d9e-ffac89ee50c5", "properties": {"Assigned":{"people":[{"id":"5ac96c02-49a4-4320-8de6-b663ba83126b","object":"user"}],"type":"people"}}}

| API-patch-page {"page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81d1-8abb-dcdb6878029a", "properties": {"Assigned":{"people":[{"id":"5ac96c02-49a4-4320-8de6-b663ba83126b","object":"user"}],"type":"people"}}}

| API-patch-page {"page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8157-b057-c9b1db392293", "properties": {"Assigned":{"people":[{"id":"5ac96c02-49a4-4320-8de6-b663ba83126b","object":"user"}],"type":"people"}}}

| API-patch-page {"page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8170-83b3-fd09de740959", "properties": {"Assigned":{"people":[{"id":"5ac96c02-49a4-4320-8de6-b663ba83126b","object":"user"}],"type":"people"}}}

| API-patch-page {"page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8191-88af-cb800460c105", "properties": {"Assigned":{"people":[{"id":"5ac96c02-49a4-4320-8de6-b663ba83126b","object":"user"}],"type":"people"}}}

| API-patch-page {"page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8101-b4ab-f0024a9f52cc", "properties": {"Assigned":{"people":[{"id":"5ac96c02-49a4-4320-8de6-b663ba83126b","object":"user"}],"type":"people"}}}
Now I need to reassign the 3 tasks that were originally assigned to the user with the fewest tasks to the user who had the most tasks:
| API-patch-page {"page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-810e-b26a-ef11106c7912", "properties": {"Assigned":{"people":[{"id":"ac7a3bd0-c111-4464-8f45-8a857a1abc8a","object":"user"}],"type":"people"}}}

| API-patch-page {"page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-813d-b48f-f2e8e018f11c", "properties": {"Assigned":{"people":[{"id":"ac7a3bd0-c111-4464-8f45-8a857a1abc8a","object":"user"}],"type":"people"}}}

| API-patch-page {"page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8163-ba84-d0b2c52a117c", "properties": {"Assigned":{"people":[{"id":"ac7a3bd0-c111-4464-8f45-8a857a1abc8a","object":"user"}],"type":"people"}}}
Perfect! I have successfully completed the task swap. Let me verify the changes by querying the tasks database again to confirm the assignments have been swapped:
| API-post-database-query {"database_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81ff-bd22-c40d5c0f0e29", "filter": {"or":[{"property":"Assigned","people":{"contains":"ac7a3bd0-c111-4464-8f45-8a857a1abc8a"}},{"property":"Assigned","people":{"contains":"5ac96c02-49a4-4320-8de6-b663ba83126b"}}]}}
Perfect! I have successfully completed the task swap on the Team Projects page. Here's a summary of what I accomplished:

## Task Completion Summary

I found the Team Projects page and analyzed the task assignments in the Tasks database. I identified:

**Before the swap:**
- **User with MOST tasks**: `ac7a3bd0-c111-4464-8f45-8a857a1abc8a` had **9 tasks** (not 8as I initially counted - I missed one task)
- **User with FEWEST tasks**: `5ac96c02-49a4-4320-8de6-b663ba83126b` had **3 tasks**

**Tasks swapped:**

**From the user with most tasks to the user with fewest tasks (9 tasks):**
1. "Research popular integrations"
2. "Analyze existing onboarding data" 
3. "Design and develop an interface"
4. "Test the integration in production"
5. "Determine feature set support"
6. "Test the social media integration"
7. "Train support staff on best practices"
8. "Test the knowledge base with users"
9. "Test the integration in a dev environment"

**From the user with fewest tasks to the user with most tasks (3 tasks):**
1. "Set up automated responses"
2. "Determine which topics we should cover"
3. "Decide which features to support"

**After the swap:**
- The user who previously had 9 tasks now has 3 tasks
- The user who previously had 3 tasks now has 9 tasks

The task assignments have been completely swapped, balancing the workload by redistributing tasks between the person who was overloaded and the person who had the lightest workload. All task reassignments were successfully completed and verified.
