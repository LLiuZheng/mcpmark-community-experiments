I'll help you complete the SOP template for the "Software Deployment Process". Let me first search for the existing SOP page and then systematically update all the sections as specified.
| API-post-search {"query": "Standard Operating Procedure", "filter": {"property":"object","value":"page"}}
Great! I found the SOP page. Now let me retrieve the page content to see the current structure:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-80e4-8ebe-d041d6a40ef5"}
Now I need to examine the column structure to find the header information in the left column. Let me get the children of the first column_list:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8109-b782-ea8b5f8515fb"}
Let me check the first column's content (left column with header info):
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81df-88f5-c9cce38ad3b2"}
Now let me check the "People team" child page to see its current content:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-810b-83d8-fc12b0bef2d3"}
Now let me check the "Relevant Docs" toggle to see its children:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81f1-9268-c79e686f707c"}
Let me check the content of each child_page under "Relevant Docs":
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8192-a40b-def6bfe4731d"}

| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-812f-b01e-d086b076d99c"}

| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81bd-bb55-d03f3925a1f1"}
Now let me check the Tools section child pages:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-817a-ab22-e5dea7430f24"}

| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8139-846d-cd687368bf70"}
Perfect! Now I have the complete structure. Let me start updating the SOP systematically. I'll begin with the header information in the left column:

## 1. Update SOP Title
