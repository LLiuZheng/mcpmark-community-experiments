I'll help you add the Research Assistant position to your Online Resume page. Let me start by finding your resume page and examining its structure.
| API-post-search {"query": "Online Resume"}
Now let me retrieve the resume page to examine its content structure:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-80fe-9ccf-fff1bdd7d9d0"}
Let me examine the column list structure to understand the layout better:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81b0-b305-d51bd0b2c86d"}
Let me check the content of both columns to understand the structure and find the Work History section:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81d6-98b9-d0296fb4b158"}
Now let me check the main content column (the right column) to find the Work History section:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81e4-b88a-f455d8b52248"}
Perfect! I found the Work History section. I can see there are two work experience entries in column lists (blocks `2562b7e8-cebd-8126-a32a-ea173367c2e9` and `2562b7e8-cebd-813c-a92c-e7bd217d8d10`). Let me examine the first one to understand the formatting:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8126-a32a-ea173367c2e9"}
Let me examine the content of both columns to understand the structure:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8173-8ce7-ee309c02a725"}

| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-818a-8a98-e69aa27122dc"}
Now let me check the second work experience entry to confirm the pattern:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-813c-a92c-e7bd217d8d10"}
Let me check the Education section to get the university logo that you mentioned should be used for the Research Assistant position:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-812e-9c99-ee8b54a1d592"}

| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81f2-ac8f-f5852865e556"}
Perfect! Now I have all the information I need. I can see the structure:

1. Work History section has a heading, a divider, and then work experiences in column lists
2. Each work experience has:
   - A small column (0.125 width) with a company logo image
   - A large column (0.875 width) with:
     - Position title (bold)
     - Date range (italic, gray color)
     - Description (normal text, gray color)
     - Empty paragraph for spacing

3. The university logo from the Education section should be used for the Research Assistant position.

Now I'll add the new Research Assistant position after the existing work experiences. I need to add it as a new column list after the second work experience but before the Education section.
| API-patch-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81e4-b88a-f455d8b52248", "after": "2562b7e8-cebd-813c-a92c-e7bd217d8d10", "children": [{"type":"column_list","column_list":{}}]}
I need to provide the full structure including the columns. Let me create the new work entry with the proper structure:
| API-patch-block-children {"after": "2562b7e8-cebd-813c-a92c-e7bd217d8d10", "block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81e4-b88a-f455d8b52248", "children": [{"type":"column_list","column_list":{"children":[{"type":"column","column":{"width_ratio":0.125,"children":[{"type":"image","image":{"type":"file","file":{"url":"https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/99ea616b-a979-41c7-81dd-723df646c9c8/228e2d29-b83a-416d-9489-394624c29e32/imperial-college-london-logo-E7D84B3293-seeklogo.com.png"}}}]}},{"type":"column","column":{"width_ratio":0.875,"children":[{"type":"paragraph","paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"Research Assistant"},"annotations":{"bold":true}}]}},{"type":"paragraph","paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"January - August 2023"},"annotations":{"italic":true,"color":"gray"}}]}},{"type":"paragraph","paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"Assisted in conducting user experience research projects at my bachelor's program, supporting data collection, analyzing user feedback, and preparing research reports. Developed strong skills in research methodologies and improved collaboration with interdisciplinary teams."},"annotations":{"color":"gray"}}]}},{"type":"paragraph","paragraph":{"rich_text":[]}}]}}]}}]}
The API is requiring the image to be provided as an external URL. Let me fix this by using the external format:
| API-patch-block-children {"after": "2562b7e8-cebd-813c-a92c-e7bd217d8d10", "block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81e4-b88a-f455d8b52248", "children": [{"column_list":{"children":[{"column":{"children":[{"image":{"external":{"url":"https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/99ea616b-a979-41c7-81dd-723df646c9c8/228e2d29-b83a-416d-9489-394624c29e32/imperial-college-london-logo-E7D84B3293-seeklogo.com.png"},"type":"external"},"type":"image"}],"width_ratio":0.125},"type":"column"},{"column":{"children":[{"paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"annotations":{"bold":true},"text":{"content":"Research Assistant"},"type":"text"}]},"type":"paragraph"},{"paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"annotations":{"color":"gray","italic":true},"text":{"content":"January - August 2023"},"type":"text"}]},"type":"paragraph"},{"paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"annotations":{"color":"gray"},"text":{"content":"Assisted in conducting user experience research projects at my bachelor's program, supporting data collection, analyzing user feedback, and preparing research reports. Developed strong skills in research methodologies and improved collaboration with interdisciplinary teams."},"type":"text"}]},"type":"paragraph"},{"paragraph":{"rich_text":[]},"type":"paragraph"}],"width_ratio":0.875},"type":"column"}]},"type":"column_list"}]}
Excellent! The Research Assistant position has been successfully added to your Online Resume. Let me verify that it was added correctly by checking the new column list:
