I'll help you find and modify the Japan Travel Planner to remove the itinerary items in Osaka after 6 PM for Day 1 and Day 2. Let me start by searching for the Japan Travel Planner.
| API-post-search {"query": "Japan Travel Planner"}
Great! I found the Japan Travel Planner page. Now let me retrieve the page content to see its structure and find the Travel Itinerary database.
| API-retrieve-a-page {"page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8061-8a12-d506cd78b8e8"}
Now let me get the children of the Japan Travel Planner page to find all the content including the Travel Itinerary database.
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8061-8a12-d506cd78b8e8"}
Perfect! I found the Travel Itinerary database with ID `2562b7e8-cebd-81be-a0ff-cff9bfbb2fdb`. Now let me query this database to see all the itinerary items.
| API-post-database-query {"database_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81be-a0ff-cff9bfbb2fdb"}
Now I need to analyze the data to identify the Osaka itinerary items for Day 1 and Day 2 that are scheduled after 6 PM. Let me examine the items and identify the ones to remove:

From the data, I can see the Osaka items (Group = "Osaka") for Day 1 and Day 2 with their time schedules:

**Day 1 (Osaka items after 6 PM):**
1. **Rikuro's Namba Main Branch** - Notes: "7 PM" (after 6 PM, needs to be removed)
2. **Takoume Honten (Oden)** - Notes: "6 PM" (exactly 6 PM, should be kept)
3. **Ebisubashi Bridge** - Notes: "9 PM" (after 6 PM, needs to be removed)

**Day 2 (Osaka items after 6 PM):**
1. **Shin Sekai "New World"** - Notes: "8 PM" (after 6 PM, needs to be removed)
2. **Katsudon Chiyomatsu** - Notes: "7:30 PM" (after 6 PM, needs to be removed)

Let me remove these items by archiving them:
| API-update-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81c6-8b4b-d7933f0ace01", "archived": true}
I need to use the page update endpoint instead. Let me archive/delete the items that need to be removed:
| API-patch-page {"page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81c6-8b4b-d7933f0ace01", "archived": true}

| API-patch-page {"archived": true, "page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8159-855a-d96e34647df0"}

| API-patch-page {"archived": true, "page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81fb-a7b5-d0f1ee899dea"}

| API-patch-page {"archived": true, "page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8191-8aa5-c92404122ac5"}
Perfect! I have successfully removed all the itinerary items in Osaka that were scheduled after 6PM for Day 1and Day 2. Here's a summary of what was completed:

## Task Completed Successfullyâœ…

I successfully removed all Osaka itinerary items scheduled after 6 PM (excluding6 PM) for Day 1 and Day 2 from the Japan Travel Planner:

### Items Removed from Day 1:
1. **Rikuro's Namba Main Branch** - 7PM (Food/Cafe)
2. **Ebisubashi Bridge** - 9 PM (Shopping/Attractions)

### Items Removed from Day 2:
1. **Shin Sekai "New World"** - 8 PM (Shopping)
2. **Katsudon Chiyomatsu** - 7:30 PM (Food)

### Items Kept (were exactly at 6 PM):
- **Takoume Honten (Oden)** - 6 PM (Day 1) - This was kept as it's exactly at 6 PM, not after
- **Kuromon Ichiba Market** - 6 PM (Day 2) - This was kept as it's exactly at 6 PM, not after

All the specified items have been archived (removed) from the travel itinerary database, effectively removing them from the active itinerary while preserving the data for potential future reference. The modifications are now live in the Japan Travel Planner.
