I'll help you find the "Online Resume" page and reorganize the projects section as requested. Let me start by searching for the page and then work through each requirement step by step.
| API-post-search {"query": "Online Resume", "filter": {"property":"object","value":"page"}}
Let me try a broader search to find pages that might contain "Resume":
| API-post-search {"filter": {"property":"object","value":"page"}, "query": "Resume"}
Let me search for all pages to see what's available:
| API-post-search {"filter": {"property":"object","value":"page"}, "query": ""}
Perfect! I found the "Online Resume" page. Now let me retrieve it to see its structure:
| API-retrieve-a-page {"page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-80dc-8597-f811093d7c5b"}
Now let me get the blocks/content of the Online Resume page:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-80dc-8597-f811093d7c5b"}
Let me explore the column_list to see its content:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81f9-8220-e98a05589af9"}
Let me examine both columns. First, the left column (25% width):
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-816a-a3c1-c9e1266b3775"}
Great! I found the contact information. Now let me examine the right column (75% width):
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8134-bbf8-e76eb5e1384c"}
Perfect! I found the Projects database with ID `2562b7e8-cebd-8157-90e4-e8819c19ff37` and the Skills database with ID `2562b7e8-cebd-81f7-a71e-dc80d4be4467`. Now let me:

1. First, get the highest skill from the Skills database
2. Get projects from the Projects database to find "Knitties eComm Website" to delete
3. Get the projects database structure to understand the fields
4. Complete all the tasks

Let me start with the Skills database to find the highest skill level:
| API-post-database-query {"database_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81f7-a71e-dc80d4be4467", "sorts": [{"property":"Skill Level","direction":"descending"}]}
Perfect! The highest skill is **Photoshop** with **90%** (0.9) skill level. Now let me get the projects from the Projects database to find "Knitties eComm Website":
| API-post-database-query {"database_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8157-90e4-e8819c19ff37"}
Perfect! I found the "Knitties eComm Website" project with ID `2562b7e8-cebd-81ae-83f5-d8534cbfb5e2`. I also see there's a "UI Design" tag already available. Now let me get the database structure to understand all the fields:
| API-retrieve-a-database {"database_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8157-90e4-e8819c19ff37"}
Now I have all the information I need. I need to add Phone and Url fields to the database, but I notice the database doesn't have those fields yet. Let me start implementing the tasks:

1. First, let me delete the "Knitties eComm Website" project:
| API-update-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81ae-83f5-d8534cbfb5e2", "archived": true}
Let me use the correct API to archive the page:
| API-patch-page {"archived": true, "page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81ae-83f5-d8534cbfb5e2"}
Great! The "Knitties eComm Website" project has been deleted. Now I need to:

2. Update the database to add Phone and URL fields and the new "Enterprise" tag
3. Create the new "Zapier Dashboard Redesign" project

First, let me update the database to add the Phone and URL fields and create the new "Enterprise" tag:
| API-update-a-database {"database_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8157-90e4-e8819c19ff37", "properties": {"Phone":{"type":"phone_number"},"Url":{"type":"url"},"Tags":{"type":"multi_select","multi_select":{"options":[{"name":"Non-Profit","color":"yellow"},{"name":"Design Assets","color":"red"},{"name":"UI Design","color":"default"},{"name":"Website Dev","color":"pink"},{"name":"Enterprise","color":"purple"}]}}}}
I need to fix the property structure. Let me try again with the correct format:
| API-update-a-database {"database_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8157-90e4-e8819c19ff37", "properties": {"Phone":{"phone_number":{},"type":"phone_number"},"Tags":{"multi_select":{"options":[{"color":"yellow","name":"Non-Profit"},{"color":"red","name":"Design Assets"},{"color":"default","name":"UI Design"},{"color":"pink","name":"Website Dev"},{"color":"purple","name":"Enterprise"}]},"type":"multi_select"},"Url":{"url":{},"type":"url"}}}
Perfect! The database has been updated with the Phone and URL fields, and the "Enterprise" tag has been added. Now I need to create a new page for the "Zapier Dashboard Redesign" project. Let me first create the page in the database:
| API-post-page {"parent": {"database_id":"2562b7e8-cebd-8157-90e4-e8819c19ff37"}, "properties": {"Name":[{"text":{"content":"Zapier Dashboard Redesign"}}],"Description":[{"text":{"content":"Led the complete redesign of Zapier's main dashboard, focusing on improved usability and modern design patterns. Implemented new navigation system and responsive layouts."}}],"Date":{"start":"2024-01-01","end":"2024-06-30"},"Tags":[{"name":"UI Design"},{"name":"Enterprise"}],"Phone":"+44 7871263013","Url":"www.zinenwine.com"}}
Excellent! The "Zapier Dashboard Redesign" project has been created successfully. Now I need to add the additional blocks after the Projects database. I need to find where the Projects database block is and add blocks after it:
| API-patch-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8134-bbf8-e76eb5e1384c", "after": "2562b7e8-cebd-8157-90e4-e8819c19ff37", "children": [{"type":"divider"},{"type":"heading_2","heading_2":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"Current Focus"}}]}},{"type":"paragraph","paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"The Zapier Dashboard Redesign represents my most impactful recent work, leveraging my expertise in Photoshop (90%) to deliver enterprise-grade solutions that prioritize both aesthetics and functionality."}}]}}]}
I need to fix the block structure. Let me add the divider field properly:
| API-patch-block-children {"after": "2562b7e8-cebd-8157-90e4-e8819c19ff37", "block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8134-bbf8-e76eb5e1384c", "children": [{"type":"divider","divider":{}},{"type":"heading_2","heading_2":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"Current Focus"}}]}},{"type":"paragraph","paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"The Zapier Dashboard Redesign represents my most impactful recent work, leveraging my expertise in Photoshop (90%) to deliver enterprise-grade solutions that prioritize both aesthetics and functionality."}}]}}]}
