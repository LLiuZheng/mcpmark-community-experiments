I'll help you remove the itinerary items in Osaka after 6 PM (excluding 6 PM) for Day 1 and Day 2 from the Japan Travel Planner. Let me start by searching for the Japan Travel Planner and then examine its structure.
| API-post-search {"query": "Japan Travel Planner"}
This appears to be showing an expense item rather than the travel planner. Let me search more specifically for the travel planner page:
| API-post-search {"query": "Japan Travel Planner Osaka Day 1"}
Great! I found some travel planner data. I can see there's an Osaka Castle entry for Day 1. Let me search more broadly for the travel planner to find the main page:
| API-post-search {"query": "Travel Planner"}
Perfect! I found the Travel Itinerary database. Now let me query this database to find all entries for Osaka on Day 1 and Day 2:
| API-post-database-query {"database_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81ce-b7f6-fd20f12466db", "filter": {"and":[{"property":"Group","select":{"equals":"Osaka"}},{"or":[{"property":"Day","select":{"equals":"Day 1"}},{"property":"Day","select":{"equals":"Day 2"}}]}]}}
Excellent! Now I can see all the Osaka itinerary items for Day 1and Day 2. Based on the task requirements, I need to remove items scheduled after 6PM (excluding6 PM itself, which means6:01 PM and later). Let me analyze the times:

**Day 1 items to remove (after 6 PM):**
-Rikuro's Namba Main Branch (7PM) - ID: 2562b7e8-cebd-8108-bca4-fd00fbbd2071
- Ebisubashi Bridge (9 PM) - ID: 2562b7e8-cebd-81e4-a681-cbde963e82a2

**Day 2 items to remove (after 6 PM):**
- Katsudon Chiyomatsu (7:30 PM) - ID: 2562b7e8-cebd-81c4-8347-f60dfd0e8758
- Shin Sekai "New World" (8PM) - ID: 2562b7e8-cebd-814f-b91e-c52c6be56fac

**Items to keep (at 6 PM or earlier):**
- Takoume Honten (Oden) - 6 PM (this is exactly at 6 PM, so we keep it)
- Kuromon Ichiba Market - 6 PM (this is exactly at 6 PM, so we keep it)

Now I'll delete the items that are scheduled after 6 PM:
| API-delete-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8108-bca4-fd00fbbd2071"}

| API-delete-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81e4-a681-cbde963e82a2"}

| API-delete-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81c4-8347-f60dfd0e8758"}

| API-delete-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-814f-b91e-c52c6be56fac"}
Perfect! I have successfully removed all the Osaka itinerary items that were scheduled after 6 PM from both Day 1 and Day 2. Here's a summary of what was removed:

**From Day 1:**
- **Rikuro's Namba Main Branch** (7 PM) - Fluffy pancakes cafe
- **Ebisubashi Bridge** (9 PM) - Shopping area with the Glico Man

**From Day 2:**
- **Katsudon Chiyomatsu** (7:30 PM) - Restaurant serving katsudon
- **Shin Sekai "New World"** (8 PM) - Shopping district with tower

**Items kept at exactly 6 PM:**
- **Takoume Honten (Oden)** - Day 1 at 6 PM (kept as requested)
- **Kuromon Ichiba Market** - Day 2 at 6 PM (kept as requested)

All the items scheduled after 6 PM (excluding 6 PM itself) have been successfully removed from the Japan Travel Planner's Osaka itinerary for Day 1 and Day 2. The remaining schedule now ends at 6 PM for both days as requested.
