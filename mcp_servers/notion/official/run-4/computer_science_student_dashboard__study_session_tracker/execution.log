I'll help you create a new study-session entry in the Computer Science Student Dashboard. Let me first locate the page and then find the Habit tracker section to add the new date section with to-do items.
| API-post-search {"query": "Computer Science Student Dashboard"}
Now let me get the content of the Computer Science Student Dashboard page to find the Habit tracker section:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8059-805e-d589ca4cca94"}
I can see the structure, but I need to find the Habit tracker section. Let me check the column_list blocks to find where the Habit tracker might be located:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8195-9c4e-c3e196705a34"}
Let me check each column to find the Habit tracker section:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8122-b32e-c50b567990a4"}
Let me check the second column:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8153-9d04-d84c84b9c226"}
Let me check the third column, which is likely where the Habit tracker is:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8116-8200-e234097f07ac"}
Perfect! I found the Habit tracker section. I can see:

1. The ☑️ Habit tracker heading (block_id: 2562b7e8-cebd-8119-8fbe-e31a15af1f6c)
2. The 2022-09-02 date (block_id: 2562b7e8-cebd-811c-8c17-cb019fb09a93)
3. Four to-do items for2022-09-02
4. A divider (block_id: 2562b7e8-cebd-81a6-9581-f69dbe4ad5db)
5. Then the 2022-09-01 date and its to-do items

I need to insert a new date section with today's date (2025-01-13) and the four specified to-do items right after the2022-09-02 to-do items but before the divider. I'll use the "after" parameter to insert them after the last2022-09-02 to-do item (📕 Read, block_id: 2562b7e8-cebd-810f-8e47-c3566ff2704e).

Let me create the new date section and to-do items:
| API-patch-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8116-8200-e234097f07ac", "after": "2562b7e8-cebd-810f-8e47-c3566ff2704e", "children": [{"type":"paragraph","paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"2025-01-13"},"annotations":{"bold":true}}]}},{"type":"to_do","to_do":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"🧠 Review algorithms for technical interview"}}],"checked":false}},{"type":"to_do","to_do":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"📚 Study database systems chapter 7"}}],"checked":false}},{"type":"to_do","to_do":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"⚡ Practice system design problems"}}],"checked":false}},{"type":"to_do","to_do":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"🎯 Complete data structures assignment"}}],"checked":false}}]}
Perfect! I have successfully created a new study-session entry in the Computer Science Student Dashboard's ☑️ Habit tracker section. Here's what I accomplished:

✅ **Task Completed Successfully**

1. **Located the ☑️ Habit tracker section** - Found it in the third column of the page layout
2. **Inserted a new date section** - Added "2025-01-13" with proper bold formatting, positioned exactly after the 2022-09-02 to-do items but before the divider block
3. **Added four unchecked to-do blocks** with the exact content you specified:
   - 🧠 Review algorithms for technical interview
   - 📚 Study database systems chapter 7
   - ⚡ Practice system design problems
   - 🎯 Complete data structures assignment

The new date section and to-do items are now properly positioned in the habit tracker, maintaining the chronological order (newest dates first) and following the same formatting style as the existing entries. All to-do items are initially unchecked as requested, and they appear in the correct location within the page structure.
