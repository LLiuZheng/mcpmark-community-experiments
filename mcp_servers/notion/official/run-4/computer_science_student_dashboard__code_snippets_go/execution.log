I'll help you find the "Computer Science Student Dashboard" page and add a Go column to the "Code Snippets" section. Let me start by searching for the page.
| API-post-search {"query": "Computer Science Student Dashboard"}
Great! I found the "Computer Science Student Dashboard" page. The page ID is `2562b7e8-cebd-8008-ad39-f178f6b1ad27`. Now let me retrieve the page content to see its structure and find the "Code Snippets" section.
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8008-ad39-f178f6b1ad27"}
Perfect! I can see the page structure. I found the "Code snippets" section with the heading "üßë‚Äçüíª Code snippets" (block ID: `2562b7e8-cebd-815a-b5a6-ebc6659d0919`), and there's a column_list block right after it (ID: `2562b7e8-cebd-811f-9a8b-ce51eaccbcf8`). Let me examine the existing columns in the Code Snippets section to see the current structure.
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-811f-9a8b-ce51eaccbcf8"}
Great! I can see there are 3 columns in the Code Snippets section. Now let me check each column to identify which ones are Python and JavaScript so I can position the Go column correctly between them.
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8106-ab82-e81a9b31349a"}

| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81f5-8c62-d97b3658d797"}

| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8149-9eb7-f2907b114e7f"}
Perfect! Now I can see the structure:
- Column 1: CSS (block ID: `2562b7e8-cebd-8106-ab82-e81a9b31349a`)
- Column 2: Python (block ID: `2562b7e8-cebd-81f5-8c62-d97b3658d797`)
- Column 3: JavaScript (block ID: `2562b7e8-cebd-8149-9eb7-f2907b114e7f`)

According to the task requirements, I need to add a Go column **between the Python and JavaScript columns**. This means I need to:
1. Add a new column after the Python column (column 2)
2. Add the Go content to that new column

Let me start by adding a new column between Python and JavaScript. I'll use the patch-block-children API to append a new column after the Python column.
| API-patch-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-811f-9a8b-ce51eaccbcf8", "after": "2562b7e8-cebd-81f5-8c62-d97b3658d797", "children": [{"type":"column","column":{}}]}
I see that the API expects the column to have children defined. Let me create the column with its content directly. I'll add the Go column with all the required content.
| API-patch-block-children {"after": "2562b7e8-cebd-81f5-8c62-d97b3658d797", "block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-811f-9a8b-ce51eaccbcf8", "children": [{"type":"column","column":{"children":[{"type":"paragraph","paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"Go"},"annotations":{"bold":true}}]}},{"type":"code","code":{"caption":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"Basic Go program"}}],"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"package main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    fmt.Println(\"Hello, World!\")\n}"}}],"language":"go"}},{"type":"code","code":{"caption":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"For loop in Go"}}],"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {\n    fmt.Println(i)\n}"}}],"language":"go"}},{"type":"code","code":{"caption":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"Function definition in Go"}}],"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"func add(a, b int) int {\n    return a + b\n}"}}],"language":"go"}}]}}]}
Excellent! I successfully added the new Go column (ID: `2562b7e8-cebd-810d-8703-f10e83fea869`) between the Python and JavaScript columns. Let me verify that the content was added correctly by checking the children of the new Go column.
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-810d-8703-f10e83fea869"}
Perfect! I have successfully completed the task. Let me verify the final structure by checking the column list one more time to confirm the order is correct.
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-811f-9a8b-ce51eaccbcf8"}
Excellent! I have successfully completed all the requirements of the task. Here's a summary of what I accomplished:

## Task Completed Successfully ‚úÖ

I found the "Computer Science Student Dashboard" page and successfully added a new Go column to the "Code Snippets" section with all the required specifications:

### ‚úÖ **Column Positioning**
- The Go column has been positioned correctly **between the Python and JavaScript columns**
- Current order: CSS ‚Üí Python ‚Üí **Go** ‚Üí JavaScript

### ‚úÖ **Header**
- Added a bold paragraph containing exactly the text `Go` at the top of the column

### ‚úÖ **Code Blocks**
I added three code blocks with `language` set to **go**, each with the exact content and captions as specified:

1. **Basic Go program** (Caption: "Basic Go program")
   ```go
   package main

   import "fmt"

   func main() {
       fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
   }
   ```

2. **For loop in Go** (Caption: "For loop in Go")
   ```go
   for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
       fmt.Println(i)
   }
   ```

3. **Function definition in Go** (Caption: "Function definition in Go")
   ```go
   func add(a, b int) int {
       return a + b
   }
   ```

The Go column has been successfully created and positioned exactly where requested, with all the specified content formatted correctly with the proper language syntax highlighting.
