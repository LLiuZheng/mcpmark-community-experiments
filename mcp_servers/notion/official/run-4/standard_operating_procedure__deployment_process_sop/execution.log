I'll help you complete the SOP template with comprehensive, interconnected content for a "Software Deployment Process" SOP. Let me start by searching for the Standard Operating Procedure page and then systematically update all sections as requested.
| API-post-search {"query": "Standard Operating Procedure", "filter": {"property":"object","value":"page"}}
Great! I found the Standard Operating Procedure page. Now let me retrieve its content to understand the current structure:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-80f4-b420-c5ca02fba21f"}
Now I need to examine the column layout to understand the structure better and then get the children of specific blocks. Let me check the column_list structure first:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81dd-8be4-d13c1cafd285"}
Let me check the left column content (where the SOP header information should be):
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81ed-b979-e04b428bc12a"}
Let me also check the content of the "People team" child page to understand how to update its callout:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8140-9d12-e991ca725419"}
Now let me check the "Relevant Docs" toggle to see its child pages:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8111-8c8a-dd4f71ebecb9"}
Now let me check the content of these child pages to see their callouts. Let me start with the first one:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81d5-a0b1-f82e550ece9c"}

| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8198-ab11-da992baa8c44"}

| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8163-b880-e6e58b2f789d"}
Now let me check the Tools section child pages:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81b3-9344-f48a5dcb1c5c"}

| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81da-b030-c6301a982ac8"}
Perfect! Now I have a complete understanding of the SOP template structure. Let me systematically update all the sections as requested. I'll start with the SOP header information:

## 1. Update SOP Header Information (Left Column)
| API-update-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8175-9482-f7d22fc6624d", "type": {"heading_1":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"Software Deployment Process"}}]}}}
I need to use the correct format for updating blocks. Let me fix this:
| API-update-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8175-9482-f7d22fc6624d", "heading_1": {"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"Software Deployment Process"},"type":"text"}]}}
Great! Now update the creation date:
| API-update-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-815f-9055-fdf9f24e95a7", "paragraph": {"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"Created 2025-01-19"},"type":"text"}]}}
Now update the responsible department:
| API-update-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81ee-8d42-eb06ea239535", "paragraph": {"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"Responsible department: DevOps Engineering Team"},"type":"text"}]}}
Now update the People team page callout:

Access required for all deployment activities."},"type":"text"}],"icon":{"type":"emoji","emoji":"💡"},"color":"gray_background"}}
## 2. Fill the Purpose section
| API-update-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81d4-91f3-f2d7b36f164b", "paragraph": {"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"This SOP defines the standardized process for deploying software applications to production environments, ensuring zero-downtime deployments, proper rollback procedures, and compliance with security protocols. This procedure applies to all production deployments and must be followed by all engineering teams."},"type":"text"}]}}
## 3. Complete the Context section
| API-update-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-815c-ab50-f1cc6cbd6b30", "paragraph": {"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"Software deployments are critical operations that can impact system availability and user experience. This process has been developed based on industry best practices and our incident response learnings from Q3 2023. All deployments must go through automated testing pipelines and require approval from designated reviewers."},"type":"text"}]}}
Now update the three child pages under "Relevant Docs" toggle:
| API-update-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8101-b68c-c7b816356732", "callout": {"color":"gray_background","icon":{"emoji":"💡","type":"emoji"},"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"Change Management Policy (SOP-001) - Defines approval workflows and change review processes for all production modifications."},"type":"text"}]}}

Now I need to replace the existing bullet point and add the four terminologies. First, let me update the existing one, then add three more:
| API-update-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8159-9afc-d812be5e86f5", "bulleted_list_item": {"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"Blue-Green Deployment: A deployment strategy that maintains two identical production environments"},"type":"text"}]}}
Now I need to add the three additional terminology bullet points after this one:
| API-patch-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-80f4-b420-c5ca02fba21f", "after": "2562b7e8-cebd-8159-9afc-d812be5e86f5", "children": [{"type":"bulleted_list_item","bulleted_list_item":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"Rollback Window: The maximum time allowed to revert a deployment (30 minutes)"}}]}},{"type":"bulleted_list_item","bulleted_list_item":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"Smoke Test: Initial verification tests run immediately after deployment"}}]}},{"type":"bulleted_list_item","bulleted_list_item":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"Production Gateway: The approval checkpoint before production release"}}]}}]}
Perfect! Now let's continue with the Tools section:

##5. Populate Tools section
| API-update-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81a4-a622-c2367351d1bc", "paragraph": {"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"Critical tools required for deployment operations:"},"type":"text"}]}}
Now I need to update the titles of the child pages first. Let me update them to "Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline" and "Kubernetes Dashboard":
| API-patch-page {"page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81b3-9344-f48a5dcb1c5c", "properties": {"title":[{"text":{"content":"Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline"},"type":"text"}],"type":"title"}}

Now update the callouts for these tool pages:
| API-update-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-816a-8327-edc70286a2ca", "callout": {"color":"gray_background","icon":{"emoji":"💡","type":"emoji"},"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline - Primary deployment automation tool with integrated testing and approval workflows. Required for all automated deployments."},"type":"text"}]}}

| API-update-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-816a-9764-ebcecacaaedb", "callout": {"color":"gray_background","icon":{"emoji":"💡","type":"emoji"},"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"Kubernetes Dashboard - Container orchestration monitoring and management interface for deployment verification and rollback operations."},"type":"text"}]}}
## 6. Complete Roles & responsibilities
| API-update-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8133-8eab-f5c863d64b9c", "paragraph": {"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"The following roles are essential for successful deployment execution:"},"type":"text"}]}}
Now I need to update the empty bullet point and add three more roles. First update the existing one:
| API-update-a-block {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8183-981b-d9dfea88aa9a", "bulleted_list_item": {"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"DevOps Engineer: Executes deployment, monitors system health, initiates rollbacks if needed"},"type":"text"}]}}
Now add the three additional roles:
| API-patch-block-children {"after": "2562b7e8-cebd-8183-981b-d9dfea88aa9a", "block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-80f4-b420-c5ca02fba21f", "children": [{"bulleted_list_item":{"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"Lead Developer: Reviews code changes, approves deployment package, validates functionality"},"type":"text"}]},"type":"bulleted_list_item"},{"bulleted_list_item":{"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"QA Engineer: Verifies smoke tests, confirms user acceptance criteria"},"type":"text"}]},"type":"bulleted_list_item"},{"bulleted_list_item":{"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"Security Officer: Validates security compliance, approves security-sensitive deployments"},"type":"text"}]},"type":"bulleted_list_item"}]}
## 7. Create detailed Procedure section
