I'll help you create that table! Let me start by finding your "Team Projects" page and the "Projects" database, then query the tasks that meet your criteria.
| API-post-search {"query": "Team Projects", "filter": {"property":"object","value":"page"}}
Great! I found the "Team Projects" page. Now let me search for the "Projects" database.
| API-post-search {"filter": {"property":"object","value":"database"}, "query": "Projects"}
I see there's a "Projects" database, but I notice it has a "Tasks" relation property, which suggests the actual task data might be in a separate database. Let me also check if there's a "Tasks" database since the projects database has a relation to tasks.
| API-post-search {"filter": {"property":"object","value":"database"}, "query": "Tasks"}
Perfect! I can see there are two databases:
1. **Projects** database - contains project information including Progress (rollup), Priority, Eng hours, Timeline
2. **Tasks** database - contains individual tasks with Status, Due dates, and relations to Projects

Based on your requirements, I need to query for tasks (from both databases potentially) that meet your criteria. Let me first get the complete structure of the Projects database to understand how progress and other fields are structured:
| API-post-database-query {"database_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8118-a16d-cd96939830f5"}
Great! I can see the Projects data. Now let me analyze which projects meet your criteria:

**Criteria:**
1. Progress is 50% or less (≤ 0.5), OR
2. Priority is P0 but not yet completed (progress not at 100%)

Looking at the projects:
1. "Publish support knowledge base" - Progress: 0(0%), Priority: P0✅
2. "Integrate with a popular third-party service" - Progress: 0.2 (20%)✅  
3. "Add support for video chat" - Progress: 1 (100%), Priority: P0❌ (P0 but completed)
4. "Improve response times for support requests" - Progress: 0.33 (33%) ✅
5. "Create customer knowledge base" - Progress: 0.4 (40%) ✅
6. "Add a new social media integration" - Progress: 0.4 (40%) ✅
7. "Redesign the onboarding process" - Progress: 0.75 (75%), Priority: P0 ✅ (P0 but not100%)

Now I need to create the table on the Team Projects page. Let me create a database with the 5 columns you requested, sorted by End Date in ascending order:
| API-create-a-database {"parent": {"type":"page_id","page_id":"2562b7e8-cebd-8003-94c6-caf2d2428dae"}, "title": [{"type":"text","text":{"content":"Task Progress Report"}}], "properties": {"Project":{"title":{}},"Eng Hours":{"title":{},"description":"Engineering hours allocated to the project"},"Progress":{"title":{},"description":"Progress percentage (as text)"},"Start Date":{"title":{},"description":"Project start date"},"End Date":{"title":{},"description":"Project end date"}}}
I need to fix the properties structure. Only one column can be the title, and others should be different property types:
| API-create-a-database {"parent": {"page_id":"2562b7e8-cebd-8003-94c6-caf2d2428dae","type":"page_id"}, "properties": {"Project":{"title":{}},"Eng Hours":{"rich_text":{}},"Progress":{"rich_text":{}},"Start Date":{"rich_text":{}},"End Date":{"rich_text":{}}}, "title": [{"text":{"content":"Task Progress Report"},"type":"text"}]}
Excellent! The database has been created. Now I need to add the qualifying projects as rows. Let me prepare the data and sort it by End Date. Based on the project data I retrieved, here are the qualifying projects in chronological order by end date:

1. "Improve response times for support requests" (End: 2024-11-17)
2. "Integrate with a popular third-party service" (End: 2024-11-18)  
3. "Create customer knowledge base" (End: 2024-11-25)
4. "Add a new social media integration" (End: 2024-11-25)
5. "Publish support knowledge base" (End: 2024-11-29)
6. "Redesign the onboarding process" (End: 2024-12-04)

Let me add these as pages to the database:
| API-post-page {"parent": {"database_id":"2562b7e8-cebd-8128-8b2a-ee209c5dd7c0"}, "properties": {"title":[{"text":{"content":"Improve response times for support requests"}}],"type":"title"}}
Let me fix the properties structure. I need to use the exact property schema:
| API-post-page {"parent": {"database_id":"2562b7e8-cebd-8128-8b2a-ee209c5dd7c0"}, "properties": {"Project":[{"text":{"content":"Improve response times for support requests"}}],"Eng Hours":[{"text":{"content":"100"}}],"Progress":[{"text":{"content":"33%"}}],"Start Date":[{"text":{"content":"2024-10-30"}}],"End Date":[{"text":{"content":"2024-11-17"}}]}}
Great! The first entry was created successfully. Now let me add the remaining entries:
| API-post-page {"parent": {"database_id":"2562b7e8-cebd-8128-8b2a-ee209c5dd7c0"}, "properties": {"End Date":[{"text":{"content":"2024-11-18"}}],"Eng Hours":[{"text":{"content":"250"}}],"Progress":[{"text":{"content":"20%"}}],"Project":[{"text":{"content":"Integrate with a popular third-party service"}}],"Start Date":[{"text":{"content":"2024-11-10"}}]}}

| API-post-page {"parent": {"database_id":"2562b7e8-cebd-8128-8b2a-ee209c5dd7c0"}, "properties": {"End Date":[{"text":{"content":"2024-11-25"}}],"Eng Hours":[{"text":{"content":"150"}}],"Progress":[{"text":{"content":"40%"}}],"Project":[{"text":{"content":"Create customer knowledge base"}}],"Start Date":[{"text":{"content":"2024-11-19"}}]}}

| API-post-page {"parent": {"database_id":"2562b7e8-cebd-8128-8b2a-ee209c5dd7c0"}, "properties": {"End Date":[{"text":{"content":"2024-11-25"}}],"Eng Hours":[{"text":{"content":"200"}}],"Progress":[{"text":{"content":"40%"}}],"Project":[{"text":{"content":"Add a new social media integration"}}],"Start Date":[{"text":{"content":"2024-11-07"}}]}}

| API-post-page {"parent": {"database_id":"2562b7e8-cebd-8128-8b2a-ee209c5dd7c0"}, "properties": {"End Date":[{"text":{"content":"2024-11-29"}}],"Eng Hours":[{"text":{"content":"Not specified"}}],"Progress":[{"text":{"content":"0%"}}],"Project":[{"text":{"content":"Publish support knowledge base"}}],"Start Date":[{"text":{"content":"2024-11-27"}}]}}

| API-post-page {"parent": {"database_id":"2562b7e8-cebd-8128-8b2a-ee209c5dd7c0"}, "properties": {"End Date":[{"text":{"content":"2024-12-04"}}],"Eng Hours":[{"text":{"content":"300"}}],"Progress":[{"text":{"content":"75%"}}],"Project":[{"text":{"content":"Redesign the onboarding process"}}],"Start Date":[{"text":{"content":"2024-11-20"}}]}}
