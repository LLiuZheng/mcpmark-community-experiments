I'll help you complete this task. Let me start by searching for the "It Trouble Shooting Hub" page and then locate the "IT Homepage" database within it.
| API-post-search {"query": "It Trouble Shooting Hub", "filter": {"property":"object","value":"page"}}
Found the "It Trouble Shooting Hub" page. Now let me retrieve its children to find the "IT Homepage" database.
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-80cc-a72b-ece8ee52d31b"}
Perfect! I found the "IT Homepage" database with ID `2562b7e8-cebd-81d4-81b3-ef97379d5087`. Now let me query this database to find all pages with expired verification status (except "It Inventory").
| API-post-database-query {"database_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81d4-81b3-ef97379d5087", "filter": {"and":[{"property":"Verification","verification":{"equals":"expired"}},{"property":"Page","title":{"does_not_equal":"It Inventory"}}]}}
Let me first retrieve the database schema to understand how to filter properly.
| API-retrieve-a-database {"database_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81d4-81b3-ef97379d5087"}
Now let me query the database properly. Let me try a simpler approach by getting all pages first and then filtering.
| API-post-database-query {"database_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81d4-81b3-ef97379d5087"}
Great! I can see the pages in the database. From the results, I can identify the following pages with expired verification status (excluding "IT Inventory" which is not in the list):

1. "What Is IT in Charge Of" (ID: 2562b7e8-cebd-81dd-a88f-ee6a462d5a6e) - Verification expired
2. "Security Awareness Guide" (ID: 2562b7e8-cebd-81ed-886a-fab0dbd7e2e0) - Verification expired  
3. "How to Submit a Ticket" (ID: 2562b7e8-cebd-814b-ae63-fbe05744118c) - Verification expired

Now I need to add callout blocks to each of these pages. Let me start with the first page.
| API-patch-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81dd-a88f-ee6a462d5a6e", "children": [{"type":"callout","callout":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"VERIFICATION EXPIRED - This page needs review and re-verification"}}],"icon":{"type":"emoji","emoji":"⚠️"},"color":"red_background"}}]}
Now let me add the callout to the second page:
| API-patch-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81ed-886a-fab0dbd7e2e0", "children": [{"callout":{"color":"red_background","icon":{"emoji":"⚠️","type":"emoji"},"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"VERIFICATION EXPIRED - This page needs review and re-verification"},"type":"text"}]},"type":"callout"}]}
Now let me add the callout to the third page:
| API-patch-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-814b-ae63-fbe05744118c", "children": [{"callout":{"color":"red_background","icon":{"emoji":"⚠️","type":"emoji"},"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"VERIFICATION EXPIRED - This page needs review and re-verification"},"type":"text"}]},"type":"callout"}]}
Perfect! Now I need to create a new entry in the "IT Requests" database. I already found the database ID earlier: `2562b7e8-cebd-81df-b309-ecf161c36160`. Let me create the new page with the specified properties and then add the bulleted list of page mentions.
| API-post-page {"parent": {"database_id":"2562b7e8-cebd-81df-b309-ecf161c36160"}, "properties": {"Task name":[{"text":{"content":"Batch Verification Update Required"}}],"Priority":{"select":{"name":"High"}},"Status":{"select":{"name":"In progress"}}}, "children": ["placeholder"]}
Let me check the IT Requests database schema to understand the correct property format:
| API-retrieve-a-database {"database_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81df-b309-ecf161c36160"}
Now I can see the exact property structure. Let me create the page with the correct property format:
| API-post-page {"children": ["placeholder"], "parent": {"database_id":"2562b7e8-cebd-81df-b309-ecf161c36160"}, "properties": {"Priority":{"type":"select","select":{"name":"High"}},"Status":{"type":"status","status":{"name":"In progress"}},"Task name":{"type":"title","title":[{"text":{"content":"Batch Verification Update Required"}}]}}}
Let me fix the children parameter:
| API-post-page {"parent": {"database_id":"2562b7e8-cebd-81df-b309-ecf161c36160"}, "properties": {"Priority":{"select":{"name":"High"}},"Status":{"status":{"name":"In progress"}},"Task name":[{"text":{"content":"Batch Verification Update Required"}}]}}
Let me try a different approach and look at one of the existing entries to understand the exact format:
| API-retrieve-a-page {"page_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-813d-a287-fbd5db18aa6f"}
Now I understand the structure better. Let me create the page with the correct property format:
| API-post-page {"parent": {"database_id":"2562b7e8-cebd-81df-b309-ecf161c36160"}, "properties": {"Task name":{"type":"title","title":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"Batch Verification Update Required"}}]},"Priority":{"type":"select","select":{"name":"High"}},"Status":{"type":"status","status":{"name":"In progress"}}}}
Great! The page has been created successfully. Now I need to add the bulleted list with mentions of each processed page. Let me add the content to the newly created page:
| API-patch-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81d2-a3d9-d1bb11ea7db5", "children": [{"bulleted_list_item":{"rich_text":[{"mention":{"page":{"id":"2562b7e8-cebd-81dd-a88f-ee6a462d5a6e"}},"type":"mention"}]},"type":"bulleted_list_item"},{"bulleted_list_item":{"rich_text":[{"mention":{"page":{"id":"2562b7e8-cebd-81ed-886a-fab0dbd7e2e0"}},"type":"mention"}]},"type":"bulleted_list_item"},{"bulleted_list_item":{"rich_text":[{"mention":{"page":{"id":"2562b7e8-cebd-814b-ae63-fbe05744118c"}},"type":"mention"}]},"type":"bulleted_list_item"}]}
Perfect! I have successfully completed all the required tasks:
