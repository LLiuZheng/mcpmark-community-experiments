I'll help you create the Learning Metrics Dashboard section for the Python Roadmap page. Let me start by gathering the necessary data from the Steps database and then locate the Python Roadmap page to add the content.
| API-post-search {"query": "Python Roadmap", "filter": {"property":"object","value":"page"}}
Good! I found the Python Roadmap page. Now let me search for the Steps database to gather the metrics data.
| API-post-search {"filter": {"property":"object","value":"database"}, "query": "Steps"}
Great! Now let me query the Steps database to get all the data I need for the metrics.
| API-post-database-query {"database_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-812d-9702-dfdfe4aa4bf8", "page_size": 100}
Now I need to get information about the chapters to understand the level classifications. Let me search for the Chapters database.
| API-post-search {"filter": {"property":"object","value":"database"}, "query": "Chapters"}
Let me query the Chapters database to get the level information.
| API-post-database-query {"database_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-816f-b8f8-d40b6ea11978"}
Perfect! Now I have all the data I need. Let me analyze the data:

**Chapter/Level Mapping:**
- Beginner Level: ID `2562b7e8-cebd-8110-9a01-d7d833ff2a05` (22 lessons)
- Intermediate Level: ID `2562b7e8-cebd-8157-8f36-cc189a0987c1` (7 lessons)  
- Advanced Level: ID `2562b7e8-cebd-818a-960f-e9d312e1a025` (4 lessons)

**Statistics from Steps database (33 total lessons):**
- Done: 11 lessons
- In Progress: 1 lesson  
- To Do: 21 lessons

**Done lessons:**
1. Data Types
2. Introduction
3. What is Python
4. Comments
5. Print
6. Setup Your Environment
7. Input
8. Variables
9. String
10. Numbers
11. Intro to Data Types

Let me count by level:
- Beginner: 22 lessons, 10 completed
- Intermediate: 7 lessons, 0 completed  
- Advanced: 4 lessons, 0 completed

Now let me get the Python Roadmap page content to find where to insert the dashboard.
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-80cd-a4ed-f0ee20546337"}
Perfect! I found the Learning Materials section (ID: `2562b7e8-cebd-813f-942d-d1ccef4dcfbb`). I need to add the Learning Metrics Dashboard after the Learning Materials section and before the paragraph that starts with "Whether you're starting from scratch...". 

Let me add the dashboard content after the Learning Materials section. I'll insert it after the empty paragraph block (ID: `2562b7e8-cebd-8118-be83-cb7c16eb0b44`).
| API-patch-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-80cd-a4ed-f0ee20546337", "after": "2562b7e8-cebd-8118-be83-cb7c16eb0b44", "children": [{"type":"heading_3","heading_3":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"üìä Learning Metrics Dashboard"}}]}},{"type":"callout","callout":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"Course Statistics","link":null},"annotations":{"bold":true}}],"color":"brown_background"}},{"type":"toggle","toggle":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"üèÜ Completed Topics (Click to expand)"}}]}}]}
Great! Now I need to add the bulleted list content to the callout block. Let me add the statistics to the callout.
| API-patch-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8127-bf1a-d6b15b13cb17", "children": [{"bulleted_list_item":{"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"Total Lessons: 33"},"type":"text"}]},"type":"bulleted_list_item"},{"bulleted_list_item":{"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"Completed: 11 (33.3%)"},"type":"text"}]},"type":"bulleted_list_item"},{"bulleted_list_item":{"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"In Progress: 1 (3.0%)"},"type":"text"}]},"type":"bulleted_list_item"},{"bulleted_list_item":{"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"Beginner Level: 22 lessons (10 completed)"},"type":"text"}]},"type":"bulleted_list_item"},{"bulleted_list_item":{"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"Intermediate Level: 7 lessons (0 completed)"},"type":"text"}]},"type":"bulleted_list_item"},{"bulleted_list_item":{"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"Advanced Level: 4 lessons (0 completed)"},"type":"text"}]},"type":"bulleted_list_item"}]}
Perfect! Now I need to add the numbered list of completed topics to the toggle block. Based on my analysis, I have11 completed lessons, but I need to list exactly 5 as requested. Let me add the first 5 completed lessons to the toggle.
| API-patch-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-813b-8d34-cffa8e01d46a", "children": [{"paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"1. Data Types"},"type":"text"}]},"type":"paragraph"},{"paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"2. Introduction"},"type":"text"}]},"type":"paragraph"},{"paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"3. What is Python"},"type":"text"}]},"type":"paragraph"},{"paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"4. Comments"},"type":"text"}]},"type":"paragraph"},{"paragraph":{"rich_text":[{"text":{"content":"5. Print"},"type":"text"}]},"type":"paragraph"}]}
Excellent! I have successfully created the Learning Metrics Dashboard section for the Python Roadmap page. Let me verify the placement by checking the page structure again.
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-80cd-a4ed-f0ee20546337"}
Perfect! I have successfully created the comprehensive Learning Metrics Dashboard for the Python Roadmap page. Here's a summary of what I accomplished:

##‚úÖ **Task Completed Successfully!**

### **What was created:**

1. **üìä Learning Metrics Dashboard Header** (heading_3)
   - Added immediately after the Learning Materials section as requested

2. **Course Statistics Callout Block** (brown background with bold title)
   - **Total Lessons**: 33
   - **Completed**: 11 (33.3%) 
   - **In Progress**: 1 (3.0%)
   - **Beginner Level**: 22 lessons (10completed)
   - **Intermediate Level**: 7 lessons (0 completed) 
   - **Advanced Level**: 4 lessons (0 completed)

3. **üèÜ Completed Topics Toggle Section**
   - Contains a numbered list of the first 5 completed lessons:
     1. Data Types
     2. Introduction  
     3. What is Python
     4. Comments
     5. Print

### **Data Analysis Summary:**
- **Total entries**: 33 lessons from the Steps database
