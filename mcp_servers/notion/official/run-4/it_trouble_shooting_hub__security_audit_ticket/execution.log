I'll help you create a comprehensive security audit ticket based on the data in your IT Trouble Shooting Hub. Let me start by searching for the relevant pages and databases.
| API-post-search {"query": "IT Trouble Shooting Hub"}
Great! I found the IT Trouble Shooting Hub page. Now let me get the children of this page to find the various databases.
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8076-bb03-fe0f49941cba"}
Perfect! I can see the IT Homepage (2562b7e8-cebd-8103-8545-cbb05aa7687e), IT FAQs (2562b7e8-cebd-817b-979f-fad9ac82490c), and IT Requests (2562b7e8-cebd-812f-8309-d633523bc266) databases. Let me check the IT Homepage database to see if it contains the IT Inventory:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8103-8545-cbb05aa7687e"}
Let me look into the column_list block to find the IT Inventory database:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-81fb-bfe7-d368dd47b26b"}
Let me check the first column which should contain the IT Inventory database:
| API-get-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8153-b7dc-fbe8b247808e"}
Perfect! I found the IT Inventory database (2562b7e8-cebd-8195-bce0-fa3d863e0076). Now let me:

1. Query the IT Inventory database for items with expiration dates before 2023-07-15
2. Query the IT FAQs database for entries with "Security" tag
3. Create the security audit page

Let me start by querying the IT Inventory database:
| API-post-database-query {"database_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8195-bce0-fa3d863e0076", "filter": {"property":"Expiration date","date":{"before":"2023-07-15"}}}
Great! I found 5 expired inventory items. Now let me search for FAQ entries with the "Security" tag in the IT FAQs database. First, let me query the IT FAQs database to see what Security-related entries exist:
| API-post-database-query {"database_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-817b-979f-fad9ac82490c", "filter": {"property":"Category","select":{"equals":"Security & Malware"}}}
Perfect! I found 3 security-related FAQ entries. Now let me create the security audit page in the IT Requests database. I'll create the page with the exact title and properties specified:
| API-post-page {"parent": {"page_id":"2562b7e8-cebd-812f-8309-d633523bc266"}, "properties": {"title":[{"text":{"content":"Quarterly Security Audit - Expired Assets Review"}}],"type":"title"}, "children": [""]}
Let me fix the children parameter and create the page in the database:
| API-post-database-query {"database_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-812f-8309-d633523bc266", "page_size": 1}
Let me create a page directly using the proper API. I need to create a database page, which should use the database as parent and set properties:
| API-post-page {"parent": {"database_id":"2562b7e8-cebd-812f-8309-d633523bc266"}, "properties": {"Task name":{"title":[{"text":{"content":"Quarterly Security Audit - Expired Assets Review"}}]},"Priority":{"select":{"name":"High"}},"Due":{"date":{"start":"2023-06-22"}}}}
Perfect! I've successfully created the security audit page. Now I need to add the bullet-list content to the page body. Let me add the bulleted list items for each expired inventory item:
| API-patch-block-children {"block_id": "2562b7e8-cebd-8130-85c1-d643af4756b8", "children": [{"type":"bulleted_list_item","bulleted_list_item":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"32x11PIP - Computer Accessory - Contact IT support immediately and disconnect from network"}}]}},{"type":"bulleted_list_item","bulleted_list_item":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"36x10PIQ - Computer Accessory - Implement spam filtering and security monitoring"}}]}},{"type":"bulleted_list_item","bulleted_list_item":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"65XYQ/GB - License - Report security incident and update security protocols"}}]}},{"type":"bulleted_list_item","bulleted_list_item":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"76x87PCY - Laptop - Enable full disk encryption and update antivirus protection"}}]}},{"type":"bulleted_list_item","bulleted_list_item":{"rich_text":[{"type":"text","text":{"content":"192371-8910/54 - Computer Accessory - Perform security assessment and implement access controls"}}]}}]}
Perfect! I have successfully created a comprehensive security audit ticket based on the data in the IT Trouble Shooting Hub. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:
