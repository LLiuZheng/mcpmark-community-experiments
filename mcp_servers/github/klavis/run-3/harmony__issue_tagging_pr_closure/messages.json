    "content": "Please execute the following task in my repository mcpmark-eval-zl/harmony:\n\nI need you to simulate a realistic development workflow where an enhancement issue is created, implementation is attempted via a pull request, but then the PR must be closed without merging due to technical constraints discovered during the implementation process.\n\n**Step 1: Create Enhancement Issue**\nCreate a new issue with:\n- Title containing: \"Upgrade JavaScript demo to use ESM imports\" and \"modern module system\"\n- Body must include:\n  - A \"## Problem\" heading describing CommonJS limitations\n  - A \"## Proposed Solution\" heading about ESM migration\n  - A \"## Benefits\" heading listing advantages\n  - Reference to issue #26 (which is about JavaScript demo issues)\n  - Keywords: \"CommonJS\", \"ESM imports\", \"module bundling\", \"modern JavaScript\"\n- Labels: Add \"enhancement\" label to the issue\n\n**Step 2: Create Feature Branch**\nCreate a new branch called 'feat/esm-migration-attempt' from main.\n\n**Step 3: Attempt ESM Implementation**\nOn the feature branch, update the file `javascript/demo/package.json` with:\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"webpack --mode production --entry ./src/main.js\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@openai/harmony\": \"^0.1.0\",\n    \"webpack\": \"^5.0.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlso create `javascript/demo/src/main.js` with:\n```javascript\n// ESM import attempt - fails due to harmony core requirements\nimport { HarmonyEncoding } from '@openai/harmony';\n\n// This breaks the existing CommonJS integration\n// harmony core requires specific CommonJS patterns\nexport const initHarmony = () => {\n    throw new Error(\"ESM migration incompatible with harmony core\");\n};\n```\n\n**Step 4: Create Pull Request**\nCreate a pull request from 'feat/esm-migration-attempt' to 'main' with:\n- Title containing: \"Upgrade JavaScript demo to ESM imports\" and \"modern modules\"\n- Body must include:\n  - A \"## Summary\" heading explaining the attempted migration\n  - A \"## Changes\" heading with bullet points about ESM implementation\n  - A \"## Issues Discovered\" heading describing technical problems found\n  - \"Addresses #[ISSUE_NUMBER]\" pattern linking to your created issue\n  - Keywords: \"ESM migration\", \"webpack configuration\", \"module compatibility\", \"breaking changes\"\n- Labels: Add \"enhancement\" and \"needs-investigation\" labels to the PR\n\n**Step 5: Investigate and Document Problems**\nAdd a comment to the PR explaining the technical barriers discovered. The comment must contain these exact keywords:\n- \"CommonJS required\"\n- \"breaking compatibility\" \n- \"build system constraints\"\n- \"core tokenization\"\n- \"approach is not viable\"\nAlso include technical analysis of harmony core's CommonJS dependencies and webpack configuration conflicts.\n\n**Step 6: Update Issue with Findings**\nAdd a comment to the original issue you created. The comment must contain these exact keywords:\n- \"technical constraints\"\n- \"CommonJS dependency\"\n- \"harmony core limitations\" \n- \"build system compatibility\"\n- \"not viable at this time\"\nAlso reference the PR number using \"PR #[NUMBER]\" pattern and provide detailed explanation of why ESM migration cannot proceed.\n\n**Step 7: Close PR Without Merging**\nClose the pull request without merging by updating its state to 'closed', and add a final comment. The comment must contain these exact keywords:\n- \"architectural limitations\"\n- \"future consideration\" \n- \"core refactoring required\"\n- \"cannot be merged\"\nAlso explain why the PR cannot be merged, what would need to change in the future, reference back to the issue, and add \"wontfix\" label to the PR.\n\n**Step 8: Close Issue**\nClose the original issue by updating its state to 'closed'. Add a final comment to the issue that must contain these exact keywords:\n- \"closing as not planned\"\n- \"architectural constraints\"\n- \"future implementation blocked\"\n- \"requires core redesign\"\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",
