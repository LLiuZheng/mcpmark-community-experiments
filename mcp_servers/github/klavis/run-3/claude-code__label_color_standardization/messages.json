    "content": "Please execute the following task in my repository mcpmark-eval-zl/claude-code:\n\nI need you to implement a comprehensive label documentation and organization workflow for the repository.\n\n**Step 1: Create Label Documentation Issue**\nCreate a new issue with:\n- Title containing: \"Document label organization for better visual organization\" and \"label guide\"\n- Body must include:\n  - A \"## Problem\" heading describing the need for better label documentation\n  - A \"## Proposed Solution\" heading about creating a comprehensive label guide for different label categories\n  - A \"## Benefits\" heading listing improved visual organization and easier issue triage\n  - Keywords: \"label documentation\", \"visual organization\", \"label guide\", \"organization\"\n- Labels: Initially add \"enhancement\" and \"documentation\" labels to the issue\n\n**Step 2: Create Feature Branch**\nCreate a new branch called 'feat/label-color-guide' from main.\n\n**Step 3: Create Label Documentation**\nOn the feature branch, create the file `docs/LABEL_COLORS.md` with:\n- A \"# Label Organization Guide\" title\n- A \"## Label Categories\" section with a table that MUST follow this exact format:\n```markdown\n| Label Name | Category | Description |\n|------------|----------|-------------|\n```\nThe table must include ALL existing labels in the repository. For each label:\n- Group labels by category (e.g., issue-type, platform, area, status, performance)\n- Include a description for each label\n\n- A \"## Usage Guidelines\" section explaining when to use each label category\n\n**Step 4: Apply ALL Labels to the Documentation Issue**\nUpdate the issue you created in Step 1 by adding ALL existing labels from the repository. This serves as a visual demonstration of the label organization. The issue should have every single label that exists in the repository applied to it.\n\n**Step 5: Create Pull Request**\nCreate a pull request from 'feat/label-color-guide' to 'main' with:\n- Title containing: \"Add label organization guide\" and \"visual organization\"  \n- Body must include:\n  - A \"## Summary\" heading explaining the label organization documentation\n  - A \"## Changes\" heading with a bullet list of what was added\n  - \"Fixes #[ISSUE_NUMBER]\" pattern linking to your created issue\n  - A \"## Verification\" section stating that all labels have been documented\n  - Keywords: \"label documentation\", \"organization guide\", \"visual improvement\", \"documentation\"\n- Labels: Add a reasonable subset of labels to the PR (at least 5-10 labels from different categories)\n\n**Step 6: Document Changes in Issue**\nAdd a comment to the original issue with:\n- Confirmation that the label documentation has been created\n- Total count of labels documented\n- Reference to the PR using \"PR #[NUMBER]\" pattern\n- Keywords: \"documentation created\", \"label guide complete\", \"organization complete\"\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",

If an issue affects all platforms, no platform label is needed.\\\\n\\\\n### Performance Labels\\\\nUse performance labels (memory, perf:memory) for issues specifically related to performance optimization and resource usage.\\\\n\\\\n### Status Labels\\\\nStatus labels help track the lifecycle of issues. Use these to indicate special states like duplicates, invalid reports, or issues that need community help.\\\\n\\\\n### Priority and Difficulty Labels\\\\nUse labels like \\\\\\\"help wanted\\\\\\\" to signal priority and \\\\\\\"good first issue\\\\\\\" to help newcomers find appropriate tasks to contribute to the project.\\\", \\\"branch\\\": \\\"feat/label-color-guide\\\"}\", \"include_output_fields\": [\"commit.sha\", \"content.path\"]}",
