    "content": "Please execute the following task in my repository mcpmark-eval-zl/mcpmark-cicd:\n\nI need you to create a comprehensive Pull Request automation workflow for this Node.js project. The project currently has no GitHub Actions workflows, so you'll be building a PR-focused CI/CD workflow from scratch that responds to pull request events. Here's what needs to be implemented:\n\n## Pull Request Automation Workflow\n\nCreate `.github/workflows/pr-automation.yml` that triggers on `pull_request` events (opened, synchronize, reopened) with these jobs:\n\n### 1. **code-quality** job (name: `code-quality`):\n  - Runs ESLint checks using `npm run lint`\n  - Runs Prettier formatting checks\n  - Posts code quality results as PR comment (must include keywords: \"Code Quality Report\", \"ESLint\", \"Prettier\")\n\n### 2. **testing-suite** job (name: `testing-suite`):\n  - Runs full test suite with `npm test`\n  - Generates test coverage report\n  - Posts coverage summary as PR comment (must include keywords: \"Test Coverage Report\")\n  - Uploads coverage artifacts\n\n### 3. **security-scan** job (name: `security-scan`):\n  - Runs dependency vulnerability checks\n  - Scans for secrets in code changes\n  - Creates security report as PR comment (must include keywords: \"Security Scan Report\", \"Vulnerabilities\", \"Dependencies\")\n\n### 4. **build-validation** job (name: `build-validation`):\n  - Attempts to build the application\n  - Validates all endpoints are accessible\n  - Creates deployment preview artifacts\n  - Posts build status as PR comment (must include keywords: \"Build Validation\")\n\n**IMPORTANT: All four jobs must run in parallel.**\n\n## Implementation Requirements:\n\n**Step 1: Create Feature Branch**\nCreate a new branch called `pr-automation-workflow` from main.\n\n**Step 2: Create the Workflow**\nCreate `.github/workflows/pr-automation.yml` with proper YAML syntax:\n- Appropriate triggers for pull_request events\n- All four jobs configured to run in parallel\n- Avoid identifier conflicts in github-script actions\n\n**Step 3: Create and Merge Pull Request**\nCreate a comprehensive pull request and merge it to main:\n- Title: \"Implement Pull Request Automation Workflow\"\n- Detailed description of the workflow and its purpose\n- Merge the pull request to main branch\n\n## Important Notes:\n\n- **All jobs MUST run in parallel**\n- Ensure your PR satisfies ALL required checks\n- The workflow should handle edge cases, have proper error recovery, and provide clear logging\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",

Specify the file path or directory with the `path` parameter. If you omit the `path` parameter, you will receive the contents of the repository's root directory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw file contents for files and symlinks.\\\\\\\\n- **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns the file contents in HTML. Markup languages are rendered to HTML using GitHub's open-source [Markup library](https://github.com/github/markup).\\\\\\\\n- **`application/vnd.github.object+json`**: Returns the contents in a consistent object format regardless of the content type. For example, instead of an array of objects for a directory, the response will be an object with an `entries` attribute containing the array of objects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the content is a directory, the response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory. When listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" specified as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"file\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Logically, the value _should_ be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"submodule\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This behavior exists [for backwards compatibility purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW). In the next major version of the API, the type will be returned as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"submodule\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the content is a symlink and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository, then the API responds with the content of the file. Otherwise, the API responds with an object describing the symlink itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the content is a submodule, the `submodule_git_url` field identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out the submodule at that specific commit. If the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"git\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]`) and the github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"html\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]`) will have null values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Notes**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- To get a repository's contents recursively, you can [recursively get the tree](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).\\\\\\\\n- This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you need to retrieve\\\\\\\\nmore files, use the [Git Trees API](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).\\\\\\\\n- Download URLs expire and are meant to be used just once. To ensure the download URL does not expire, please use the contents API to obtain a fresh download URL for each download.\\\\\\\\n- If the requested file's size is:\\\\\\\\n  - 1 MB or smaller: All features of this endpoint are supported.\\\\\\\\n  - Between 1-100 MB: Only the `raw` or `object` custom media types are supported. Both will work as normal, except that when using the `object` media type, the `content` field will be an empty\\\\\\\\nstring and the `encoding` field will be `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"none\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`. To get the contents of these larger files, use the `raw` media type.\\\\\\\\n  - Greater than 100 MB: This endpoint is not supported.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"tags\\\\\\\":[\\\\\\\"repos\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\"path_params\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"owner\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"string\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"format\\\\\\\":null,\\\\\\\"required\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"The account owner of the repository.
