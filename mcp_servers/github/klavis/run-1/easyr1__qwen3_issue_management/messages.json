    "content": "Please execute the following task in my repository mcpmark-eval-zl/EasyR1:\n\nThe EasyR1 repository has several Qwen3-related issues that were closed but need to be reopened for further investigation. Qwen3 is an important model variant that requires continued attention. I need you to find and reopen all closed issues related to Qwen3 and properly tag them for tracking.\n\n**Step 1: Find All Closed Qwen3 Issues**\nSearch for ALL closed issues that mention 'qwen3' (case-insensitive) in either the title or body. Make note of each issue number and title.\n\n**Step 2: Reopen Each Qwen3 Issue**\nFor every closed issue that contains 'qwen3' (regardless of when it was closed or any other factors), reopen it by changing its state from closed to open.\n\n**Step 3: Add Tracking Label**\nAfter reopening each issue, add the label `qwen3-related` to it. This will help track all Qwen3-related issues in the future.\n\n**Step 4: Create Summary Issue**\nCreate a new issue titled \"Reopened Qwen3 Issues Summary\" with the following content in the body:\n```\n# Qwen3 Issues Reopened\n\nThe following closed issues containing 'qwen3' have been reopened:\n\n[List each reopened issue as: - #NUMBER: TITLE]\n\nTotal issues reopened: [NUMBER]\n\nAll reopened issues have been tagged with the `qwen3-related` label for easy tracking.\n```\n\nAdd the label `qwen3-related` to this summary issue as well.\n\nThis straightforward workflow ensures all Qwen3-related closed issues are reopened and properly tagged for visibility.\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",
