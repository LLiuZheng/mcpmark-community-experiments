    "content": "Please execute the following task in my repository mcpmark-eval-zl/harmony:\n\nI need you to implement a complete bug tracking and resolution workflow that demonstrates proper cross-referencing between issues, pull requests, and commits. Here's what you need to do:\n\n**Step 1: Create Issue for Race Condition Bug**\nCreate a new issue with:\n- Title containing: 'race condition', 'HarmonyEncoding', 'concurrent access'\n- Body must include:\n  - A \"## Problem\" heading describing threading issues\n  - A \"## Root Cause\" heading about file locking\n  - A \"## Expected Solution\" heading with bullet points\n  - References to issues #6 and #1\n  - Keywords: \"multiple threads\", \"tokenizer file downloads\", \"mutex-based file locking\"\n\n**Step 2: Create Feature Branch**\nCreate a new branch called 'fix/race-condition-tokenizer-loading' from main.\n\n**Step 3: Implement Thread-Safe Loading**\nOn the feature branch, create/update the file `src/concurrent_loading.rs` with:\n```rust\nuse std::sync::Mutex;\nuse std::sync::OnceLock;\n\n// Thread-safe tokenizer loading with file locks\nstatic DOWNLOAD_MUTEX: OnceLock<Mutex<()>> = OnceLock::new();\n\npub fn load_harmony_encoding_safe(name: &str) -> Result<HarmonyEncoding, HarmonyError> {\n    let _guard = DOWNLOAD_MUTEX.get_or_init(|| Mutex::new(())).lock().unwrap();\n    // Implementation for thread-safe loading\n    // Addresses race condition from issue #6\n    Ok(HarmonyEncoding::new())\n}\n\npub fn load_harmony_encoding_from_file(path: &str) -> Result<HarmonyEncoding, HarmonyError> {\n    // Offline loading API as requested in issue #1\n    HarmonyEncoding::from_file(path)\n}\n```\n\n**Step 4: Create Pull Request with Cross-References**\nCreate a pull request from 'fix/race-condition-tokenizer-loading' to 'main' with:\n- Title containing: 'Fix race condition', 'tokenizer loading', 'threading issues'\n- Body must include:\n  - A \"## Summary\" heading explaining the fix\n  - A \"## Changes\" heading with bullet points about mutex implementation\n  - A \"## Testing\" heading mentioning related issues\n  - \"Closes #[ISSUE_NUMBER]\" pattern linking to your created issue\n  - References to #1 and #6\n  - Keywords: \"thread-safe\", \"concurrent downloads\", \"offline loading API\"\n\n**Step 5: Add PR Review Comments**\nCreate a pending review and add a review comment to the PR with:\n- Technical analysis of the implementation approach\n- Discussion of thread safety mechanisms\n- Keywords that must be included: \"OnceLock\", \"mutex\", \"thread safety\", \"concurrent access\"\n- Reference to issue #1 and the offline loading capability\n- Explanation of how the solution prevents race conditions\nThen submit the review as a COMMENT type review.\n\n**Step 6: Update Issue with Implementation Details**\nAdd a comment to the original issue you created with:\n- Reference to the PR number using \"PR #[NUMBER]\" pattern\n- Technical details about the mutex-based solution\n- Keywords: \"std::sync::Mutex\", \"OnceLock\", \"thread-safe initialization\"\n- Mention of key implementation changes (DOWNLOAD_MUTEX, offline loading)\n- Reference back to issue #1 for offline loading requirement\n\n**Step 7: Close the Issue**\nClose the issue you created by updating its state to 'closed' with state_reason 'completed'.\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",

The approach leverages both `OnceLock` and `mutex` patterns for comprehensive thread safety.\\\\n\\\\n### Key Technical Points:\\\\n\\\\n**OnceLock Implementation**: The use of `std::sync::OnceLock` ensures that the `DOWNLOAD_MUTEX` is initialized exactly once across all threads, providing a global synchronization point for tokenizer downloads. This prevents multiple initialization attempts that could lead to race conditions.\\\\n\\\\n**Mutex-Based Protection**: The `std::sync::Mutex` provides exclusive access to the download process, ensuring that only one thread can perform tokenizer file operations at any given time. This directly addresses the concurrent access issues identified in the original problem.\\\\n\\\\n**Thread Safety Guarantees**: The `_guard` variable ensures that the mutex lock is held for the entire duration of the function, preventing other threads from interfering with the download process. The `unwrap()` call is acceptable here since mutex poisoning would indicate a critical threading error.\\\\n\\\\n**Integration with Issue #1**: The `load_harmony_encoding_from_file()` function provides the offline loading capability requested in issue #1, allowing users to load tokenizers from local files without network dependencies.\\\\n\\\\nThis solution effectively prevents the race conditions that occur when multiple threads attempt to download the same tokenizer files simultaneously, while also providing the offline loading API requested in the original requirements.\\\", \\\"comments\\\": [{\\\"path\\\": \\\"src/concurrent_loading.rs\\\", \\\"line\\\": 6, \\\"body\\\": \\\"The `OnceLock<Mutex<()>>` pattern here is particularly elegant for thread-safe initialization. The `OnceLock` ensures the mutex is created exactly once, while the inner `Mutex<()>` provides the actual synchronization primitive. This prevents race conditions during the initialization phase itself and provides a global lock for all tokenizer downloads. This directly addresses the concurrent access issues mentioned in issue #1 regarding thread safety.\\\"}]}\", \"include_output_fields\": [\"id\", \"state\", \"html_url\"]}",
