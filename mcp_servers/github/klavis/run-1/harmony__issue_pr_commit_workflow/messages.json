    "content": "Please execute the following task in my repository mcpmark-eval-zl/harmony:\n\nI need you to implement a complete bug tracking and resolution workflow that demonstrates proper cross-referencing between issues, pull requests, and commits. Here's what you need to do:\n\n**Step 1: Create Issue for Race Condition Bug**\nCreate a new issue with:\n- Title containing: 'race condition', 'HarmonyEncoding', 'concurrent access'\n- Body must include:\n  - A \"## Problem\" heading describing threading issues\n  - A \"## Root Cause\" heading about file locking\n  - A \"## Expected Solution\" heading with bullet points\n  - References to issues #6 and #1\n  - Keywords: \"multiple threads\", \"tokenizer file downloads\", \"mutex-based file locking\"\n\n**Step 2: Create Feature Branch**\nCreate a new branch called 'fix/race-condition-tokenizer-loading' from main.\n\n**Step 3: Implement Thread-Safe Loading**\nOn the feature branch, create/update the file `src/concurrent_loading.rs` with:\n```rust\nuse std::sync::Mutex;\nuse std::sync::OnceLock;\n\n// Thread-safe tokenizer loading with file locks\nstatic DOWNLOAD_MUTEX: OnceLock<Mutex<()>> = OnceLock::new();\n\npub fn load_harmony_encoding_safe(name: &str) -> Result<HarmonyEncoding, HarmonyError> {\n    let _guard = DOWNLOAD_MUTEX.get_or_init(|| Mutex::new(())).lock().unwrap();\n    // Implementation for thread-safe loading\n    // Addresses race condition from issue #6\n    Ok(HarmonyEncoding::new())\n}\n\npub fn load_harmony_encoding_from_file(path: &str) -> Result<HarmonyEncoding, HarmonyError> {\n    // Offline loading API as requested in issue #1\n    HarmonyEncoding::from_file(path)\n}\n```\n\n**Step 4: Create Pull Request with Cross-References**\nCreate a pull request from 'fix/race-condition-tokenizer-loading' to 'main' with:\n- Title containing: 'Fix race condition', 'tokenizer loading', 'threading issues'\n- Body must include:\n  - A \"## Summary\" heading explaining the fix\n  - A \"## Changes\" heading with bullet points about mutex implementation\n  - A \"## Testing\" heading mentioning related issues\n  - \"Closes #[ISSUE_NUMBER]\" pattern linking to your created issue\n  - References to #1 and #6\n  - Keywords: \"thread-safe\", \"concurrent downloads\", \"offline loading API\"\n\n**Step 5: Add PR Review Comments**\nCreate a pending review and add a review comment to the PR with:\n- Technical analysis of the implementation approach\n- Discussion of thread safety mechanisms\n- Keywords that must be included: \"OnceLock\", \"mutex\", \"thread safety\", \"concurrent access\"\n- Reference to issue #1 and the offline loading capability\n- Explanation of how the solution prevents race conditions\nThen submit the review as a COMMENT type review.\n\n**Step 6: Update Issue with Implementation Details**\nAdd a comment to the original issue you created with:\n- Reference to the PR number using \"PR #[NUMBER]\" pattern\n- Technical details about the mutex-based solution\n- Keywords: \"std::sync::Mutex\", \"OnceLock\", \"thread-safe initialization\"\n- Mention of key implementation changes (DOWNLOAD_MUTEX, offline loading)\n- Reference back to issue #1 for offline loading requirement\n\n**Step 7: Close the Issue**\nClose the issue you created by updating its state to 'closed' with state_reason 'completed'.\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",

The technical solution employs several key thread safety mechanisms that effectively prevent race conditions during tokenizer loading.\\\\n\\\\n### Thread Safety Analysis\\\\n\\\\nThe use of **OnceLock** provides excellent thread-safe initialization guarantees, ensuring that the mutex is initialized exactly once across all threads. The **mutex**-based locking mechanism creates a critical section around the tokenizer loading process, preventing **concurrent access** to shared resources during file downloads.\\\\n\\\\n### Implementation Strengths\\\\n\\\\n- **OnceLock** ensures atomic initialization of the `DOWNLOAD_MUTEX`\\\\n- **Mutex** provides exclusive access during critical tokenizer operations  \\\\n- **Thread safety** is maintained through proper synchronization primitives\\\\n- **Concurrent access** protection prevents file corruption and duplicate downloads\\\\n\\\\nThe offline loading capability addresses the requirements from issue #1, providing users with the ability to load tokenizers from local files without network dependencies. This dual approach (online with mutex protection + offline loading) creates a comprehensive solution.\\\\n\\\\n### Race Condition Prevention\\\\n\\\\nThe implementation successfully prevents race conditions by:\\\\n1. Serializing access to tokenizer download operations\\\\n2. Using RAII guards to ensure mutex unlocking\\\\n3. Providing atomic initialization through `OnceLock`\\\\n4.
