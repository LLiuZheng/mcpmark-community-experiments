    "content": "Please execute the following task in my repository mcpmark-eval-zl/harmony:\n\nI need you to simulate a realistic development workflow where an enhancement issue is created, implementation is attempted via a pull request, but then the PR must be closed without merging due to technical constraints discovered during the implementation process.\n\n**Step 1: Create Enhancement Issue**\nCreate a new issue with:\n- Title containing: \"Upgrade JavaScript demo to use ESM imports\" and \"modern module system\"\n- Body must include:\n  - A \"## Problem\" heading describing CommonJS limitations\n  - A \"## Proposed Solution\" heading about ESM migration\n  - A \"## Benefits\" heading listing advantages\n  - Reference to issue #26 (which is about JavaScript demo issues)\n  - Keywords: \"CommonJS\", \"ESM imports\", \"module bundling\", \"modern JavaScript\"\n- Labels: Add \"enhancement\" label to the issue\n\n**Step 2: Create Feature Branch**\nCreate a new branch called 'feat/esm-migration-attempt' from main.\n\n**Step 3: Attempt ESM Implementation**\nOn the feature branch, update the file `javascript/demo/package.json` with:\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"webpack --mode production --entry ./src/main.js\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@openai/harmony\": \"^0.1.0\",\n    \"webpack\": \"^5.0.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlso create `javascript/demo/src/main.js` with:\n```javascript\n// ESM import attempt - fails due to harmony core requirements\nimport { HarmonyEncoding } from '@openai/harmony';\n\n// This breaks the existing CommonJS integration\n// harmony core requires specific CommonJS patterns\nexport const initHarmony = () => {\n    throw new Error(\"ESM migration incompatible with harmony core\");\n};\n```\n\n**Step 4: Create Pull Request**\nCreate a pull request from 'feat/esm-migration-attempt' to 'main' with:\n- Title containing: \"Upgrade JavaScript demo to ESM imports\" and \"modern modules\"\n- Body must include:\n  - A \"## Summary\" heading explaining the attempted migration\n  - A \"## Changes\" heading with bullet points about ESM implementation\n  - A \"## Issues Discovered\" heading describing technical problems found\n  - \"Addresses #[ISSUE_NUMBER]\" pattern linking to your created issue\n  - Keywords: \"ESM migration\", \"webpack configuration\", \"module compatibility\", \"breaking changes\"\n- Labels: Add \"enhancement\" and \"needs-investigation\" labels to the PR\n\n**Step 5: Investigate and Document Problems**\nAdd a comment to the PR explaining the technical barriers discovered. The comment must contain these exact keywords:\n- \"CommonJS required\"\n- \"breaking compatibility\" \n- \"build system constraints\"\n- \"core tokenization\"\n- \"approach is not viable\"\nAlso include technical analysis of harmony core's CommonJS dependencies and webpack configuration conflicts.\n\n**Step 6: Update Issue with Findings**\nAdd a comment to the original issue you created. The comment must contain these exact keywords:\n- \"technical constraints\"\n- \"CommonJS dependency\"\n- \"harmony core limitations\" \n- \"build system compatibility\"\n- \"not viable at this time\"\nAlso reference the PR number using \"PR #[NUMBER]\" pattern and provide detailed explanation of why ESM migration cannot proceed.\n\n**Step 7: Close PR Without Merging**\nClose the pull request without merging by updating its state to 'closed', and add a final comment. The comment must contain these exact keywords:\n- \"architectural limitations\"\n- \"future consideration\" \n- \"core refactoring required\"\n- \"cannot be merged\"\nAlso explain why the PR cannot be merged, what would need to change in the future, reference back to the issue, and add \"wontfix\" label to the PR.\n\n**Step 8: Close Issue**\nClose the original issue by updating its state to 'closed'. Add a final comment to the issue that must contain these exact keywords:\n- \"closing as not planned\"\n- \"architectural constraints\"\n- \"future implementation blocked\"\n- \"requires core redesign\"\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",

For more information, see \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw file contents for files and symlinks.\\\\\\\\n- **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns the file contents in HTML. Markup languages are rendered to HTML using GitHub's open-source [Markup library](https://github.com/github/markup).\\\\\\\\n- **`application/vnd.github.object+json`**: Returns the contents in a consistent object format regardless of the content type. For example, instead of an array of objects for a directory, the response will be an object with an `entries` attribute containing the array of objects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the content is a directory, the response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory. When listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" specified as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"file\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Logically, the value _should_ be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"submodule\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This behavior exists [for backwards compatibility purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW). In the next major version of the API, the type will be returned as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"submodule\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the content is a symlink and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository, then the API responds with the content of the file. Otherwise, the API responds with an object describing the symlink itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the content is a submodule, the `submodule_git_url` field identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out the submodule at that specific commit. If the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"git\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]`) and the github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"html\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]`) will have null values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Notes**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- To get a repository's contents recursively, you can [recursively get the tree](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).\\\\\\\\n- This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you need to retrieve\\\\\\\\nmore files, use the [Git Trees API](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).\\\\\\\\n- Download URLs expire and are meant to be used just once. To ensure the download URL does not expire, please use the contents API to obtain a fresh download URL for each download.\\\\\\\\n- If the requested file's size is:\\\\\\\\n  - 1 MB or smaller: All features of this endpoint are supported.\\\\\\\\n  - Between 1-100 MB: Only the `raw` or `object` custom media types are supported. Both will work as normal, except that when using the `object` media type, the `content` field will be an empty\\\\\\\\nstring and the `encoding` field will be `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"none\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`. To get the contents of these larger files, use the `raw` media type.\\\\\\\\n  - Greater than 100 MB: This endpoint is not supported.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"tags\\\\\\\":[\\\\\\\"repos\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\"path_params\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"owner\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"string\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"format\\\\\\\":null,\\\\\\\"required\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"The account owner of the repository.

The internal architecture relies on `require()` calls for dynamic module loading that cannot be easily replicated with ESM `import` statements.\\\\n\\\\n**Breaking compatibility** - Converting to ESM would break the existing API surface that external integrations depend on. The harmony core expects specific CommonJS export patterns that are not compatible with ESM syntax.\\\\n\\\\n### Build System Issues\\\\n\\\\n**Build system constraints** - The current webpack configuration and build pipeline are tightly coupled to CommonJS module resolution. Attempting to migrate creates conflicts in:\\\\n- Module resolution strategies\\\\n- Dynamic import handling  \\\\n- Node.js compatibility layers\\\\n- Third-party package integration\\\\n\\\\n**Core tokenization** dependencies prevent ESM adoption because:\\\\n- Tokenization algorithms expect synchronous `require()` calls\\\\n- Buffer handling relies on CommonJS module caching\\\\n- Performance optimizations depend on CommonJS module initialization patterns\\\\n\\\\n### Conclusion\\\\n\\\\nBased on this technical analysis, the **approach is not viable** without significant architectural changes to harmony core itself.

The harmony core has fundamental **harmony core limitations** that prevent ESM adoption:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Tokenization Engine Dependencies**: The core tokenization algorithms are built around synchronous `require()` patterns that cannot be replicated with asynchronous ESM imports\\\\n\\\\n2. **Module Loading Architecture**: Dynamic module resolution and caching mechanisms rely on CommonJS-specific behaviors\\\\n\\\\n3. **API Compatibility**: Existing integrations depend on CommonJS export patterns that would break with ESM conversion\\\\n\\\\n### Build System Analysis\\\\n\\\\n**Build system compatibility** issues include:\\\\n- Webpack configuration conflicts between CommonJS and ESM\\\\n- Node.js runtime compatibility problems\\\\n- Third-party package integration failures\\\\n- Performance regression due to module loading changes\\\\n\\\\n### Technical Verdict\\\\n\\\\nAfter comprehensive testing and analysis in PR #28, this enhancement is **not viable at this time**. The migration would require:\\\\n\\\\n- Complete rewrite of the harmony core tokenization engine\\\\n- Breaking API changes affecting all existing integrations  \\\\n- Substantial build system redesign\\\\n- Extensive testing and validation of new architecture\\\\n\\\\nThe scope of required changes extends far beyond the JavaScript demo and into core harmony architecture, making this enhancement currently unfeasible without major version changes to the entire harmony ecosystem.\\\\n\\\\nThis investigation confirms that ESM migration cannot proceed with the current harmony core design.\\\"}\", \"include_output_fields\": [\"id\", \"html_url\"]}",

Here's a summary of what was accomplished:\n\n## Workflow Summary\n\n**✅ Step 1: Enhancement Issue Created**\n- Created issue #27: \"Upgrade JavaScript demo to use ESM imports and modern module system\"\n- Included all required sections (Problem, Proposed Solution, Benefits)\n- Referenced issue #26 and included all required keywords\n- Added \"enhancement\" label\n\n**✅ Step 2: Feature Branch Created**\n- Successfully created branch `feat/esm-migration-attempt` from main\n\n**✅ Step 3: ESM Implementation Attempted**\n- Updated `javascript/demo/package.json` with ESM configuration and webpack setup\n- Created `javascript/demo/src/main.js` with ESM imports that demonstrate incompatibility\n- Both files committed to the feature branch\n\n**✅ Step 4: Pull Request Created**\n- Created PR #28: \"Upgrade JavaScript demo to ESM imports and modern modules\"\n- Included all required sections with proper linking to issue #27\n- Added \"enhancement\" and \"needs-investigation\" labels\n\n**✅ Step 5: Technical Investigation Comment**\n- Added comprehensive comment to PR #28 with all required keywords\n- Documented CommonJS requirements, build system constraints, and core tokenization issues\n- Concluded the approach is not viable\n\n**✅ Step 6: Issue Updated with Findings**\n- Added detailed comment to issue #27 with all required keywords\n- Referenced PR #28 and provided technical analysis\n- Explained why ESM migration is not viable at this time\n\n**✅ Step 7: PR Closed Without Merging**\n- Added final comment with all required keywords about architectural limitations\n- Closed PR #28 without merging\n- Added \"wontfix\" label to the PR\n\n**✅ Step 8: Issue Closed**\n- Added final comment to issue #27 with all required keywords\n- Closed issue #27 as \"not planned\"\n- Documented architectural constraints blocking future implementation\n\nThis realistic workflow demonstrates a common scenario in software development where an enhancement appears feasible initially, but technical investigation during implementation reveals fundamental architectural constraints that make the approach unviable. The workflow properly documents the investigation process, technical barriers discovered, and provides clear reasoning for why the enhancement cannot proceed without major architectural changes.\n\n**Task completed successfully!**",
