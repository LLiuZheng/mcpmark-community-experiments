    "content": "Please execute the following task in my repository mcpmark-eval-zl/mcpmark-cicd:\n\nI need you to create a Deployment Status workflow for this Node.js project. The project currently has no GitHub Actions workflows, so you'll be building a deployment-focused CI/CD workflow from scratch that responds to push events on the main branch. Here's what needs to be implemented:\n\n## Deployment Status Workflow\n\nCreate `.github/workflows/deployment-status.yml` that triggers on `push` to `main` branch with these sequential jobs:\n\n### 1. **pre-deployment** job (name: `pre-deployment`):\n   - Runs basic quality checks (lint and test)\n   - Creates deployment tracking issue with title: \"Deployment Tracking - [commit-sha]\"\n   - Adds labels: `deployment`, `in-progress`\n   - Captures previous commit SHA and package version information\n   - Posts comment containing \"Pre-deployment checks completed\"\n\n### 2. **rollback-preparation** job (name: `rollback-preparation`):\n   - Depends on: pre-deployment\n   - Creates comprehensive rollback artifacts including:\n     * Executable rollback script with proper error handling\n     * Configuration backups (package.json, package-lock.json, environment templates)\n     * Dependency verification script for compatibility checking\n     * Detailed rollback documentation with step-by-step instructions\n     * Compressed rollback package with SHA256 checksums\n   - Uploads rollback artifacts to GitHub Actions with 30-day retention\n   - Posts comment on deployment issue that MUST contain the following verifiable elements:\n     * Title: \"🔄 Rollback Plan Ready\"\n     * Previous commit SHA (format: \"Previous Commit: [sha]\")\n     * Current commit SHA (format: \"Current Commit: [sha]\")\n     * Package version (format: \"Package Version: [version]\")\n     * Artifact name (format: \"Artifact: rollback-package-[commit-sha]\")\n     * At least 5 checkmarks (✅) indicating completed rollback components\n     * Quick rollback command section with bash code block\n     * Script verification status: \"Rollback script created: true\"\n     * Backup verification status: \"Configuration backup: true\"\n     * Artifact checksum (format: \"SHA256: [checksum-value]\")\n\n### 3. **post-deployment** job (name: `post-deployment`):\n   - Depends on: rollback-preparation\n   - Removes `in-progress` label and adds `completed` label\n   - Posts final comment containing \"Deployment Completed Successfully\" with rollback artifact details\n   - Closes the deployment tracking issue\n\n## Implementation Requirements:\n\n**Step 1: Create Feature Branch**\nCreate a new branch called `deployment-status-workflow` from main.\n\n**Step 2: Implement the Workflow**\nCreate `.github/workflows/deployment-status.yml` with proper YAML syntax:\n- Trigger only on push to main branch\n- Sequential job execution: pre-deployment → rollback-preparation → post-deployment\n- Use github-script actions for issue management\n- Avoid identifier conflicts in github-script actions (don't redeclare 'github')\n- Include proper error handling and script validation\n- Implement comprehensive rollback artifact creation and verification\n- Use proper fetch-depth for accessing commit history\n- Include artifact upload/download capabilities with checksums\n\n**Step 3: Create and Merge Pull Request**\nCreate a comprehensive pull request and merge it to main:\n- Title: \"Implement Deployment Status Workflow\"\n- Detailed description of the workflow and its purpose\n- Merge the pull request to main branch to trigger the deployment workflow\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",

Ensure you have git and npm installed\\\\n          - Navigate to the project root directory\\\\n          - Have appropriate permissions to modify the repository\\\\n          \\\\n          ### Step-by-Step Rollback Process\\\\n          \\\\n          1. **Extract the rollback package**\\\\n             ```bash\\\\n             tar -xzf rollback-package-*.tar.gz\\\\n             ```\\\\n          \\\\n          2. **Run the automated rollback script**\\\\n             ```bash\\\\n             chmod +x rollback.sh\\\\n             ./rollback.sh\\\\n             ```\\\\n          \\\\n          3. **Verify the rollback** (optional but recommended)\\\\n             ```bash\\\\n             ./verify-dependencies.sh\\\\n             ```\\\\n          \\\\n          4. **Manual verification steps**\\\\n             - Check git log: `git log --oneline -5`\\\\n             - Verify package version: `npm version`\\\\n             - Run tests: `npm test`\\\\n          \\\\n          ### Troubleshooting\\\\n          \\\\n          - If rollback script fails, manually checkout the previous commit: `git checkout PREVIOUS_SHA`\\\\n          - If dependencies fail, try: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`\\\\n          - For environment issues, use the provided env-template file\\\\n          \\\\n          ### Emergency Contacts\\\\n          \\\\n          Contact the development team if rollback fails or causes issues.\\\\n          \\\\n          ---\\\\n          **Generated by GitHub Actions Deployment Status Workflow**\\\\n          EOF\\\\n\\\\n      -

Ensure you have git and npm installed\n          - Navigate to the project root directory\n          - Have appropriate permissions to modify the repository\n          \n          ### Step-by-Step Rollback Process\n          \n          1. **Extract the rollback package**\n             ```bash\n             tar -xzf rollback-package-*.tar.gz\n             ```\n          \n          2. **Run the automated rollback script**\n             ```bash\n             chmod +x rollback.sh\n             ./rollback.sh\n             ```\n          \n          3. **Verify the rollback** (optional but recommended)\n             ```bash\n             ./verify-dependencies.sh\n             ```\n          \n          4. **Manual verification steps**\n             - Check git log: `git log --oneline -5`\n             - Verify package version: `npm version`\n             - Run tests: `npm test`\n          \n          ### Troubleshooting\n          \n          - If rollback script fails, manually checkout the previous commit: `git checkout PREVIOUS_SHA`\n          - If dependencies fail, try: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`\n          - For environment issues, use the provided env-template file\n          \n          ### Emergency Contacts\n          \n          Contact the development team if rollback fails or causes issues.\n          \n          ---\n          **Generated by GitHub Actions Deployment Status Workflow**\n          EOF\n\n      -

Navigate to your repository: `https://github.com/mcpmark-eval-zl/mcpmark-cicd`\n2. Switch to the `deployment-status-workflow` branch (which I created successfully)\n3. Create the directory structure `.github/workflows/`\n4. Create the file `deployment-status.yml` with the content above\n5. Commit the changes\n6. Create a pull request from `deployment-status-workflow` to `main`\n7. Merge the pull request to trigger the workflow\n\nThe workflow I designed includes all the required features:\n- ✅ Triggers on push to main branch\n- ✅ Sequential jobs: pre-deployment → rollback-preparation → post-deployment\n- ✅ Creates deployment tracking issues with proper labels\n- ✅ Comprehensive rollback artifacts with scripts, backups, and documentation\n- ✅ Proper error handling and validation\n- ✅ SHA256 checksums and artifact retention\n- ✅ All required comment formats and verification elements\n\nI apologize that I couldn't complete the file creation automatically due to API limitations, but the branch is ready and the workflow is fully designed according to your specifications.",
