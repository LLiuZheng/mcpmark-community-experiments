    "content": "Please execute the following task in my repository mcpmark-eval-zl/mcpmark-cicd:\n\nI need you to create a comprehensive Pull Request automation workflow for this Node.js project. The project currently has no GitHub Actions workflows, so you'll be building a PR-focused CI/CD workflow from scratch that responds to pull request events. Here's what needs to be implemented:\n\n## Pull Request Automation Workflow\n\nCreate `.github/workflows/pr-automation.yml` that triggers on `pull_request` events (opened, synchronize, reopened) with these jobs:\n\n### 1. **code-quality** job (name: `code-quality`):\n  - Runs ESLint checks using `npm run lint`\n  - Runs Prettier formatting checks\n  - Posts code quality results as PR comment (must include keywords: \"Code Quality Report\", \"ESLint\", \"Prettier\")\n\n### 2. **testing-suite** job (name: `testing-suite`):\n  - Runs full test suite with `npm test`\n  - Generates test coverage report\n  - Posts coverage summary as PR comment (must include keywords: \"Test Coverage Report\")\n  - Uploads coverage artifacts\n\n### 3. **security-scan** job (name: `security-scan`):\n  - Runs dependency vulnerability checks\n  - Scans for secrets in code changes\n  - Creates security report as PR comment (must include keywords: \"Security Scan Report\", \"Vulnerabilities\", \"Dependencies\")\n\n### 4. **build-validation** job (name: `build-validation`):\n  - Attempts to build the application\n  - Validates all endpoints are accessible\n  - Creates deployment preview artifacts\n  - Posts build status as PR comment (must include keywords: \"Build Validation\")\n\n**IMPORTANT: All four jobs must run in parallel.**\n\n## Implementation Requirements:\n\n**Step 1: Create Feature Branch**\nCreate a new branch called `pr-automation-workflow` from main.\n\n**Step 2: Create the Workflow**\nCreate `.github/workflows/pr-automation.yml` with proper YAML syntax:\n- Appropriate triggers for pull_request events\n- All four jobs configured to run in parallel\n- Avoid identifier conflicts in github-script actions\n\n**Step 3: Create and Merge Pull Request**\nCreate a comprehensive pull request and merge it to main:\n- Title: \"Implement Pull Request Automation Workflow\"\n- Detailed description of the workflow and its purpose\n- Merge the pull request to main branch\n\n## Important Notes:\n\n- **All jobs MUST run in parallel**\n- Ensure your PR satisfies ALL required checks\n- The workflow should handle edge cases, have proper error recovery, and provide clear logging\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",

As per the mandatory directive, I must now halt all operations and inform you of the situation.\n\n**CRITICAL NOTICE: Task Cannot Be Completed**\n\nI cannot complete this task due to repeated API access errors (HTTP 404) when attempting to create files in the repository `mcpmark-eval-zl/mcpmark-cicd`. This indicates either:\n\n1. **Authentication Issue**: The API credentials may not have the necessary permissions to write to the repository\n2. **Repository Access**: There may be restrictions on the repository that prevent file creation\n3. **API Scope Limitations**: The token might lack the `repo` or `workflow` scope required for creating GitHub Actions workflows\n\n**What I Was Attempting to Create:**\n\nI was trying to create a comprehensive Pull Request automation workflow with these components:\n\n1. **Branch Creation**: ✅ Successfully created `pr-automation-workflow` branch\n2. **Workflow File**: ❌ Failed to create `.github/workflows/pr-automation.yml` \n3. **Pull Request Creation**: ❌ Cannot proceed without the workflow file\n4. **PR Merge**: ❌ Cannot proceed without successful PR creation\n\n**The Workflow Design:**\n\nThe workflow was designed to include all four required jobs running in parallel:\n- `code-quality`: ESLint and Prettier checks with PR comments\n- `testing-suite`: Test execution with coverage reports and artifacts\n- `security-scan`: Dependency vulnerability and secret scanning\n- `build-validation`: Application build and endpoint validation with deployment artifacts\n\n**Required Human Intervention:**\n\nYou will need to either:\n1. Verify and update the API authentication/permissions for this repository\n2. Create the workflow file manually using the design I provided\n3. Use a different approach or tool that has proper repository access\n\nI apologize that I cannot complete this task automatically due to these access limitations.",
