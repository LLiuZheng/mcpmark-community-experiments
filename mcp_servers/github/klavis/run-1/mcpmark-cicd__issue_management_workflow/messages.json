    "content": "Please execute the following task in my repository mcpmark-eval-zl/mcpmark-cicd:\n\nI need you to create an intelligent Issue Management automation workflow for this Node.js project. The project currently has no GitHub Actions workflows, so you'll be building an issue-focused automation system from scratch that responds to issue events. Here's what needs to be implemented:\n\n## Issue Management Workflow\n\nCreate `.github/workflows/issue-automation.yml` that triggers on `issues` events (opened, labeled) with these jobs:\n\n### 1. **issue-triage** job:\n   - Auto-assigns category labels based on keywords in **issue title** (case-insensitive):\n     - Title contains \"bug\" → adds `bug` label\n     - Title contains \"epic\" → adds `epic` label  \n     - Title contains \"maintenance\" → adds `maintenance` label\n   - Auto-assigns priority labels based on keywords in **issue title OR body** (case-insensitive, highest priority wins if multiple keywords found):\n     - \"critical\", \"urgent\", \"production\", \"outage\" → `priority-critical`\n     - \"important\", \"high\", \"blocking\" → `priority-high` \n     - \"medium\", \"normal\" → `priority-medium` (default if no priority keywords found)\n     - \"low\", \"nice-to-have\", \"minor\" → `priority-low`\n   - All issues get `needs-triage` label initially\n\n### 2. **task-breakdown** job:\n   - For issues with a title containing \"Epic\", create exactly 4 sub-issues with the pattern: \"[SUBTASK] [Original Title] - Task N: [Task Name]\"\n   - Task names: 1. Requirements Analysis, 2. Design and Architecture, 3. Implementation, 4. Testing and Documentation\n   - Links sub-issues to parent using \"Related to #[parent-number]\" in sub-issue body\n   - Updates parent issue body with \"## Epic Tasks\" checklist linking to sub-issue numbers\n   - All sub-issues get `enhancement` and `needs-review` labels\n\n### 3. **auto-response** job:\n   - Checks if the issue author is creating their first issue in this repository (not first on GitHub globally, but first in this specific repo)\n   - If first issue in repo: adds `first-time-contributor` label and posts welcome message\n   - Posts different responses based on issue type:\n     - `bug` issues: comment must contain \"Bug Report Guidelines\"\n     - `epic` issues: comment must contain \"Feature Request Process\"  \n     - `maintenance` issues: comment must contain \"Maintenance Guidelines\"\n   - Sets milestone \"v1.0.0\" for `priority-high` and `priority-critical` issues\n   - Changes status from `needs-triage` to `needs-review` after response\n\n## Label Management Requirements\n\nThe system must create and manage these specific labels:\n\n### Category Labels:\n- `bug` - Something isn't working\n- `enhancement` - New feature or request  \n- `epic` - Large feature requiring multiple sub-tasks\n- `maintenance` - Maintenance and housekeeping tasks\n\n### Priority Labels:\n- `priority-critical` - Critical priority issue\n- `priority-high` - High priority issue  \n- `priority-medium` - Medium priority issue\n- `priority-low` - Low priority issue\n\n### Status Labels:\n- `needs-triage` - Needs to be reviewed by maintainers\n- `needs-review` - Awaiting review from maintainers\n- `first-time-contributor` - Issue created by first-time contributor\n\n## Implementation Requirements:\n\n**Step 1: Create Feature Branch**\nCreate a new branch called `issue-management-workflow` from main.\n\n**Step 2: Create Supporting Files**\nCreate these additional files on the new branch:\n- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` - Bug report template\n- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md` - Feature request template\n- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/maintenance_report.md` - Maintenance report template\n\n\n**Step 3: Implement the Workflow**  \nCreate `.github/workflows/issue-automation.yml` with proper YAML syntax.  \nInclude:  \n- Appropriate triggers for issues events  \n- Job dependencies where needed  \n- Error handling and graceful fallbacks  \n- Avoid identifier conflicts in github-script actions (don't redeclare 'github')\n\n**Step 4: Create and Merge Pull Request**\nCreate a comprehensive pull request and merge it to main:\n- Title: \"Implement Issue Management Automation Workflow\"\n- Detailed description of the workflow and its purpose\n- Include all workflow files and templates created\n- Merge the pull request to main branch\n\n**Step 5: Test the Workflow**\nCreate test issues to demonstrate the issue automation workflow:\n\n1. **Bug Issue**: \"Bug: Login form validation not working\"\n   - Expected: `bug`, `priority-high`, `needs-triage`→`needs-review`, milestone \"v1.0.0\"\n   - Auto-response comment must contain \"Bug Report Guidelines\"\n\n2. **Epic Issue**: \"Epic: Redesign user dashboard interface\"\n   - Expected: `epic`, `priority-high`, `needs-triage`→`needs-review`, milestone \"v1.0.0\"\n   - Must create 4 sub-issues with `enhancement` and `needs-review` labels\n   - Parent updated with \"## Epic Tasks\" checklist, sub-issues linked with \"Related to #[parent-number]\"\n   - Auto-response comment must contain \"Feature Request Process\"\n\n3. **Maintenance Issue**: \"Weekly maintenance cleanup and refactor\"  \n   - Expected: `maintenance`, `priority-medium`, `needs-triage`→`needs-review`, no milestone\n   - Auto-response comment must contain \"Maintenance Guidelines\"\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",
