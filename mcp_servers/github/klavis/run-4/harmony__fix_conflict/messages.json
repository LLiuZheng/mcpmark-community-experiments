    "content": "Please execute the following task in my repository mcpmark-eval-zl/harmony:\n\nI have some pull requests that won't merge due to conflicts. Can you help me fix the merge conflicts by creating the missing infrastructure?\n\n**Step 1: Find Conflicted PR**\nLook through the open pull requests and find the one that has `mergeable: false` and `mergeable_state: \"dirty\"`. Check what file it's trying to modify - it appears to be missing a file that the PR is trying to add or modify.\n\n**Step 2: Create Infrastructure PR**  \nCreate a new branch and PR to add the missing file that the conflicted PR needs. The PR must have:\n\n- **Title**: Must contain \"Add CI infrastructure\" and \"resolve conflicts\"\n- **Body**: Must include:\n  - Reference to the conflicted PR using \"Fixes #[PR_NUMBER]\" or \"Resolves #[PR_NUMBER]\" \n  - Explanation that this \"prepares infrastructure\" for the other PR\n  - Mention of \"missing .github directory\" and \"workflow conflicts\"\n- **File Content**: Extract the complete file content from the conflicted PR's changes and add it to main. This ensures the conflicted PR can merge cleanly without conflicts.\n\n**Step 3: Merge Infrastructure PR**\nMerge the infrastructure PR to main.\n\n**Step 4: Add Comment to Original PR**\nAdd a comment to the original conflicted PR that references the infrastructure PR you just created and merged. The comment must mention the infrastructure PR number using \"PR #[NUMBER]\" format.\n\n**Step 5: Merge Original PR**\nNow merge the original conflicted PR since it should be able to merge cleanly.\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",

Markup languages are rendered to HTML using GitHub's open-source [Markup library](https://github.com/github/markup).\\\\\\\\n- **`application/vnd.github.object+json`**: Returns the contents in a consistent object format regardless of the content type. For example, instead of an array of objects for a directory, the response will be an object with an `entries` attribute containing the array of objects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the content is a directory, the response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory. When listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" specified as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"file\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Logically, the value _should_ be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"submodule\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This behavior exists [for backwards compatibility purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW). In the next major version of the API, the type will be returned as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"submodule\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the content is a symlink and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository, then the API responds with the content of the file. Otherwise, the API responds with an object describing the symlink itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the content is a submodule, the `submodule_git_url` field identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out the submodule at that specific commit. If the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"git\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]`) and the github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"html\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]`) will have null values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Notes**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- To get a repository's contents recursively, you can [recursively get the tree](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).\\\\\\\\n- This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you need to retrieve\\\\\\\\nmore files, use the [Git Trees API](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).\\\\\\\\n- Download URLs expire and are meant to be used just once. To ensure the download URL does not expire, please use the contents API to obtain a fresh download URL for each download.\\\\\\\\n- If the requested file's size is:\\\\\\\\n  - 1 MB or smaller: All features of this endpoint are supported.\\\\\\\\n  - Between 1-100 MB: Only the `raw` or `object` custom media types are supported.
