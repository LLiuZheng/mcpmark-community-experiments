Let me summarize what I accomplished:\n\n## Task Completed\n\nI have successfully:\n\n1. **Investigated the repository commit history** - I searched through the commit history of the `mcpmark-eval-zl/missing-semester` repository and found the key commit \"Begin transition to new name and domain\" (SHA: d4412ead0bd63f24cd836f0ac021243200f8c255) from December 1, 2019.\n\n2. **Found the old name and domain** - By examining the commit details, I discovered:\n   - **Old name**: \"Hacker Tools\"\n   - **Old domain**: \"hacker-tools.github.io\"\n\n3. **Created the ANSWER.md file** - I created the file with the correct format as requested:\n   ```\n   [Hacker Tools](https://hacker-tools.github.io)\n   ```\n\n4. **Pushed to master branch** - The file has been successfully committed and pushed to the `master` branch with the commit message \"Add ANSWER.md with old name and domain\".\n\nThe evidence from the commit shows that \"The Missing Semester of Your CS Education\" was indeed previously called \"Hacker Tools\" and was hosted at `hacker-tools.github.io` before transitioning to the current name and domain `missing.csail.mit.edu`.",
