    "content": "Please execute the following task in my repository mcpmark-eval-zl/harmony:\n\nI need you to simulate a realistic development workflow where an enhancement issue is created, implementation is attempted via a pull request, but then the PR must be closed without merging due to technical constraints discovered during the implementation process.\n\n**Step 1: Create Enhancement Issue**\nCreate a new issue with:\n- Title containing: \"Upgrade JavaScript demo to use ESM imports\" and \"modern module system\"\n- Body must include:\n  - A \"## Problem\" heading describing CommonJS limitations\n  - A \"## Proposed Solution\" heading about ESM migration\n  - A \"## Benefits\" heading listing advantages\n  - Reference to issue #26 (which is about JavaScript demo issues)\n  - Keywords: \"CommonJS\", \"ESM imports\", \"module bundling\", \"modern JavaScript\"\n- Labels: Add \"enhancement\" label to the issue\n\n**Step 2: Create Feature Branch**\nCreate a new branch called 'feat/esm-migration-attempt' from main.\n\n**Step 3: Attempt ESM Implementation**\nOn the feature branch, update the file `javascript/demo/package.json` with:\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"webpack --mode production --entry ./src/main.js\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@openai/harmony\": \"^0.1.0\",\n    \"webpack\": \"^5.0.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlso create `javascript/demo/src/main.js` with:\n```javascript\n// ESM import attempt - fails due to harmony core requirements\nimport { HarmonyEncoding } from '@openai/harmony';\n\n// This breaks the existing CommonJS integration\n// harmony core requires specific CommonJS patterns\nexport const initHarmony = () => {\n    throw new Error(\"ESM migration incompatible with harmony core\");\n};\n```\n\n**Step 4: Create Pull Request**\nCreate a pull request from 'feat/esm-migration-attempt' to 'main' with:\n- Title containing: \"Upgrade JavaScript demo to ESM imports\" and \"modern modules\"\n- Body must include:\n  - A \"## Summary\" heading explaining the attempted migration\n  - A \"## Changes\" heading with bullet points about ESM implementation\n  - A \"## Issues Discovered\" heading describing technical problems found\n  - \"Addresses #[ISSUE_NUMBER]\" pattern linking to your created issue\n  - Keywords: \"ESM migration\", \"webpack configuration\", \"module compatibility\", \"breaking changes\"\n- Labels: Add \"enhancement\" and \"needs-investigation\" labels to the PR\n\n**Step 5: Investigate and Document Problems**\nAdd a comment to the PR explaining the technical barriers discovered. The comment must contain these exact keywords:\n- \"CommonJS required\"\n- \"breaking compatibility\" \n- \"build system constraints\"\n- \"core tokenization\"\n- \"approach is not viable\"\nAlso include technical analysis of harmony core's CommonJS dependencies and webpack configuration conflicts.\n\n**Step 6: Update Issue with Findings**\nAdd a comment to the original issue you created. The comment must contain these exact keywords:\n- \"technical constraints\"\n- \"CommonJS dependency\"\n- \"harmony core limitations\" \n- \"build system compatibility\"\n- \"not viable at this time\"\nAlso reference the PR number using \"PR #[NUMBER]\" pattern and provide detailed explanation of why ESM migration cannot proceed.\n\n**Step 7: Close PR Without Merging**\nClose the pull request without merging by updating its state to 'closed', and add a final comment. The comment must contain these exact keywords:\n- \"architectural limitations\"\n- \"future consideration\" \n- \"core refactoring required\"\n- \"cannot be merged\"\nAlso explain why the PR cannot be merged, what would need to change in the future, reference back to the issue, and add \"wontfix\" label to the PR.\n\n**Step 8: Close Issue**\nClose the original issue by updating its state to 'closed'. Add a final comment to the issue that must contain these exact keywords:\n- \"closing as not planned\"\n- \"architectural constraints\"\n- \"future implementation blocked\"\n- \"requires core redesign\"\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",

Specify the file path or directory with the `path` parameter. If you omit the `path` parameter, you will receive the contents of the repository's root directory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw file contents for files and symlinks.\\\\\\\\n- **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns the file contents in HTML. Markup languages are rendered to HTML using GitHub's open-source [Markup library](https://github.com/github/markup).\\\\\\\\n- **`application/vnd.github.object+json`**: Returns the contents in a consistent object format regardless of the content type. For example, instead of an array of objects for a directory, the response will be an object with an `entries` attribute containing the array of objects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the content is a directory, the response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory. When listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" specified as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"file\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Logically, the value _should_ be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"submodule\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This behavior exists [for backwards compatibility purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW). In the next major version of the API, the type will be returned as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"submodule\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the content is a symlink and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository, then the API responds with the content of the file. Otherwise, the API responds with an object describing the symlink itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the content is a submodule, the `submodule_git_url` field identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out the submodule at that specific commit. If the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"git\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]`) and the github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"html\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]`) will have null values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Notes**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- To get a repository's contents recursively, you can [recursively get the tree](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).\\\\\\\\n- This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you need to retrieve\\\\\\\\nmore files, use the [Git Trees API](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).\\\\\\\\n- Download URLs expire and are meant to be used just once. To ensure the download URL does not expire, please use the contents API to obtain a fresh download URL for each download.\\\\\\\\n- If the requested file's size is:\\\\\\\\n  - 1 MB or smaller: All features of this endpoint are supported.\\\\\\\\n  - Between 1-100 MB: Only the `raw` or `object` custom media types are supported. Both will work as normal, except that when using the `object` media type, the `content` field will be an empty\\\\\\\\nstring and the `encoding` field will be `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"none\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`. To get the contents of these larger files, use the `raw` media type.\\\\\\\\n  - Greater than 100 MB: This endpoint is not supported.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"tags\\\\\\\":[\\\\\\\"repos\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\"path_params\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"owner\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"string\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"format\\\\\\\":null,\\\\\\\"required\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"The account owner of the repository.

The core tokenization system is built around CommonJS `require()` statements that cannot be easily converted to ESM imports without **breaking compatibility** with the existing API structure.\\\\n\\\\n### Build System Constraints\\\\n\\\\nThe webpack configuration faces **build system constraints** when trying to bundle ESM modules that depend on CommonJS-based **core tokenization** components. The module resolution fails because:\\\\n\\\\n1. Harmony's internal module loading expects CommonJS patterns\\\\n2. The tokenization algorithms have deep CommonJS dependencies \\\\n3. Webpack's ESM mode conflicts with harmony's CommonJS exports\\\\n4. Dynamic require() patterns in harmony core break static ESM analysis\\\\n\\\\n### Technical Analysis\\\\n\\\\nThe attempted migration reveals that harmony core's architecture is tightly coupled to CommonJS patterns for:\\\\n- Dynamic module loading for different encoding formats\\\\n- Runtime plugin discovery and initialization \\\\n- Backwards compatibility with existing CommonJS integrations\\\\n- Internal module caching and dependency resolution\\\\n\\\\nConverting to ESM would require a complete rewrite of the core tokenization engine and all dependent modules, making this **approach is not viable** for the current codebase structure.\\\\n\\\\n### Recommendation\\\\n\\\\nThis ESM migration should be deferred until a major architectural refactor of harmony core can be planned and executed.\\\"}\", \"include_output_fields\": [\"id\", \"html_url\"]}",
