    "content": "Please execute the following task in my repository mcpmark-eval-zl/mcpmark-cicd:\n\nI need you to create a comprehensive Pull Request automation workflow for this Node.js project. The project currently has no GitHub Actions workflows, so you'll be building a PR-focused CI/CD workflow from scratch that responds to pull request events. Here's what needs to be implemented:\n\n## Pull Request Automation Workflow\n\nCreate `.github/workflows/pr-automation.yml` that triggers on `pull_request` events (opened, synchronize, reopened) with these jobs:\n\n### 1. **code-quality** job (name: `code-quality`):\n  - Runs ESLint checks using `npm run lint`\n  - Runs Prettier formatting checks\n  - Posts code quality results as PR comment (must include keywords: \"Code Quality Report\", \"ESLint\", \"Prettier\")\n\n### 2. **testing-suite** job (name: `testing-suite`):\n  - Runs full test suite with `npm test`\n  - Generates test coverage report\n  - Posts coverage summary as PR comment (must include keywords: \"Test Coverage Report\")\n  - Uploads coverage artifacts\n\n### 3. **security-scan** job (name: `security-scan`):\n  - Runs dependency vulnerability checks\n  - Scans for secrets in code changes\n  - Creates security report as PR comment (must include keywords: \"Security Scan Report\", \"Vulnerabilities\", \"Dependencies\")\n\n### 4. **build-validation** job (name: `build-validation`):\n  - Attempts to build the application\n  - Validates all endpoints are accessible\n  - Creates deployment preview artifacts\n  - Posts build status as PR comment (must include keywords: \"Build Validation\")\n\n**IMPORTANT: All four jobs must run in parallel.**\n\n## Implementation Requirements:\n\n**Step 1: Create Feature Branch**\nCreate a new branch called `pr-automation-workflow` from main.\n\n**Step 2: Create the Workflow**\nCreate `.github/workflows/pr-automation.yml` with proper YAML syntax:\n- Appropriate triggers for pull_request events\n- All four jobs configured to run in parallel\n- Avoid identifier conflicts in github-script actions\n\n**Step 3: Create and Merge Pull Request**\nCreate a comprehensive pull request and merge it to main:\n- Title: \"Implement Pull Request Automation Workflow\"\n- Detailed description of the workflow and its purpose\n- Merge the pull request to main branch\n\n## Important Notes:\n\n- **All jobs MUST run in parallel**\n- Ensure your PR satisfies ALL required checks\n- The workflow should handle edge cases, have proper error recovery, and provide clear logging\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",

According to the error message, I must cease this operation and escalate to human assistance. This appears to be a fundamental access or permission issue that cannot be resolved through repeated attempts.\n\n**CRITICAL ISSUE**: I cannot complete the task of creating the GitHub workflow file due to repeated API errors. The 404 errors suggest either:\n\n1. **Permission Issues**: The API access may not have sufficient permissions to create files in the `.github/workflows` directory\n2. **Authentication Problems**: There may be authentication issues with the GitHub API\n3. **Repository Access**: The repository may not be accessible or may have restrictions\n\n**What I was attempting to accomplish:**\n- ✅ Created the feature branch `pr-automation-workflow` successfully\n- ❌ Failed to create the comprehensive PR automation workflow file at `.github/workflows/pr-automation.yml`\n- ❌ Cannot proceed with creating the pull request due to the above failure\n\n**Required Human Intervention:**\nYou'll need to manually create the workflow file with the comprehensive content I prepared, or investigate and resolve the API access issues. The workflow content I prepared includes all four required jobs (code-quality, testing-suite, security-scan, build-validation) that run in parallel and include all the specified features like ESLint, Prettier, test coverage, security scanning, and build validation with PR comments.\n\nWould you like me to provide you with the complete workflow file content so you can create it manually, or would you prefer to investigate the API access issues first?",
