    "content": "Please execute the following task in my repository mcpmark-eval-zl/mcpmark-cicd:\n\nI need you to create a Deployment Status workflow for this Node.js project. The project currently has no GitHub Actions workflows, so you'll be building a deployment-focused CI/CD workflow from scratch that responds to push events on the main branch. Here's what needs to be implemented:\n\n## Deployment Status Workflow\n\nCreate `.github/workflows/deployment-status.yml` that triggers on `push` to `main` branch with these sequential jobs:\n\n### 1. **pre-deployment** job (name: `pre-deployment`):\n   - Runs basic quality checks (lint and test)\n   - Creates deployment tracking issue with title: \"Deployment Tracking - [commit-sha]\"\n   - Adds labels: `deployment`, `in-progress`\n   - Captures previous commit SHA and package version information\n   - Posts comment containing \"Pre-deployment checks completed\"\n\n### 2. **rollback-preparation** job (name: `rollback-preparation`):\n   - Depends on: pre-deployment\n   - Creates comprehensive rollback artifacts including:\n     * Executable rollback script with proper error handling\n     * Configuration backups (package.json, package-lock.json, environment templates)\n     * Dependency verification script for compatibility checking\n     * Detailed rollback documentation with step-by-step instructions\n     * Compressed rollback package with SHA256 checksums\n   - Uploads rollback artifacts to GitHub Actions with 30-day retention\n   - Posts comment on deployment issue that MUST contain the following verifiable elements:\n     * Title: \"ðŸ”„ Rollback Plan Ready\"\n     * Previous commit SHA (format: \"Previous Commit: [sha]\")\n     * Current commit SHA (format: \"Current Commit: [sha]\")\n     * Package version (format: \"Package Version: [version]\")\n     * Artifact name (format: \"Artifact: rollback-package-[commit-sha]\")\n     * At least 5 checkmarks (âœ…) indicating completed rollback components\n     * Quick rollback command section with bash code block\n     * Script verification status: \"Rollback script created: true\"\n     * Backup verification status: \"Configuration backup: true\"\n     * Artifact checksum (format: \"SHA256: [checksum-value]\")\n\n### 3. **post-deployment** job (name: `post-deployment`):\n   - Depends on: rollback-preparation\n   - Removes `in-progress` label and adds `completed` label\n   - Posts final comment containing \"Deployment Completed Successfully\" with rollback artifact details\n   - Closes the deployment tracking issue\n\n## Implementation Requirements:\n\n**Step 1: Create Feature Branch**\nCreate a new branch called `deployment-status-workflow` from main.\n\n**Step 2: Implement the Workflow**\nCreate `.github/workflows/deployment-status.yml` with proper YAML syntax:\n- Trigger only on push to main branch\n- Sequential job execution: pre-deployment â†’ rollback-preparation â†’ post-deployment\n- Use github-script actions for issue management\n- Avoid identifier conflicts in github-script actions (don't redeclare 'github')\n- Include proper error handling and script validation\n- Implement comprehensive rollback artifact creation and verification\n- Use proper fetch-depth for accessing commit history\n- Include artifact upload/download capabilities with checksums\n\n**Step 3: Create and Merge Pull Request**\nCreate a comprehensive pull request and merge it to main:\n- Title: \"Implement Deployment Status Workflow\"\n- Detailed description of the workflow and its purpose\n- Merge the pull request to main branch to trigger the deployment workflow\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",

Specify the file path or directory with the `path` parameter. If you omit the `path` parameter, you will receive the contents of the repository's root directory.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw file contents for files and symlinks.\\\\\\\\n- **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns the file contents in HTML. Markup languages are rendered to HTML using GitHub's open-source [Markup library](https://github.com/github/markup).\\\\\\\\n- **`application/vnd.github.object+json`**: Returns the contents in a consistent object format regardless of the content type. For example, instead of an array of objects for a directory, the response will be an object with an `entries` attribute containing the array of objects.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the content is a directory, the response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory. When listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" specified as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"file\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Logically, the value _should_ be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"submodule\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This behavior exists [for backwards compatibility purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW). In the next major version of the API, the type will be returned as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"submodule\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the content is a symlink and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository, then the API responds with the content of the file. Otherwise, the API responds with an object describing the symlink itself.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf the content is a submodule, the `submodule_git_url` field identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out the submodule at that specific commit. If the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"git\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]`) and the github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"html\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"]`) will have null values.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Notes**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- To get a repository's contents recursively, you can [recursively get the tree](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).\\\\\\\\n- This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you need to retrieve\\\\\\\\nmore files, use the [Git Trees API](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).\\\\\\\\n- Download URLs expire and are meant to be used just once. To ensure the download URL does not expire, please use the contents API to obtain a fresh download URL for each download.\\\\\\\\n- If the requested file's size is:\\\\\\\\n  - 1 MB or smaller: All features of this endpoint are supported.\\\\\\\\n  - Between 1-100 MB: Only the `raw` or `object` custom media types are supported. Both will work as normal, except that when using the `object` media type, the `content` field will be an empty\\\\\\\\nstring and the `encoding` field will be `\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"none\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`. To get the contents of these larger files, use the `raw` media type.\\\\\\\\n  - Greater than 100 MB: This endpoint is not supported.\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"tags\\\\\\\":[\\\\\\\"repos\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\"path_params\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"owner\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"string\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"format\\\\\\\":null,\\\\\\\"required\\\\\\\":true,\\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"The account owner of the repository.

Download and extract the rollback artifacts\n          2. Run: `./rollback.sh`\n          3. Verify: `./verify-dependencies.sh`\n          4. Test the application\n          5. Deploy if verification passes\n          \n          ## Manual Rollback Steps\n          \n          1. Checkout previous commit: `git checkout PREVIOUS_COMMIT`\n          2. Restore package files: `git checkout PREVIOUS_COMMIT -- package.json package-lock.json`\n          3. Install dependencies: `npm ci`\n          4. Run tests: `npm test`\n          5. Deploy to production\n          \n          ## Troubleshooting\n          \n          - If rollback fails, check the error logs\n          - Verify Git repository state\n          - Ensure Node.js version compatibility\n          - Check for dependency conflicts\n          EOF\n          \n          # Create environment template\n          cat > rollback-artifacts/env.template << 'EOF'\n          # Environment Configuration Template\n          NODE_ENV=production\n          PORT=3000\n          # Add your environment variables here\n          EOF\n          \n          # Create compressed package\n          tar -czf \"rollback-package-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD).tar.gz\" -C rollback-artifacts .\n          \n          # Generate checksum\n          CHECKSUM=$(sha256sum \"rollback-package-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD).tar.gz\" | cut -d' ' -f1)\n          echo \"checksum=$CHECKSUM\" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n          \n          echo \"Rollback artifacts created successfully\"\n      \n      - name: Upload rollback artifacts\n        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4\n        with:\n          name: ${{ steps.artifact-info.outputs.artifact-name }}\n          path: rollback-package-*.tar.gz\n          retention-days: 30\n      \n      - name: Post rollback plan comment\n        uses: actions/github-script@v7\n        with:\n          script: |\n            const artifactName = '${{ steps.artifact-info.outputs.artifact-name }}';\n            const checksum = '${{ steps.create-artifacts.outputs.checksum }}';\n            const previousCommit = '${{ needs.pre-deployment.outputs.previous-commit }}';\n            const currentCommit = '${{ needs.pre-deployment.outputs.current-commit }}';\n            const packageVersion = '${{ needs.pre-deployment.outputs.package-version }}';\n            \n            const commentBody = `## ðŸ”„ Rollback Plan Ready\n            \n            **Previous Commit:** ${previousCommit}\n            **Current Commit:** ${currentCommit}\n            **Package Version:** ${packageVersion}\n            **Artifact:** ${artifactName}\n            \n            ### Rollback Components Completed\n            âœ… Executable rollback script created\n            âœ… Configuration backups (package.json, package-lock.json)\n            âœ… Dependency verification script\n            âœ… Detailed rollback documentation\n            âœ… Compressed rollback package with checksums\n            \n            ### Quick Rollback Command\n            \\`\\`\\`bash\n            # Download artifacts and execute rollback\n            ./rollback.sh\n            \\`\\`\\`\n            \n            ### Verification Status\n            **Rollback script created:** true\n            **Configuration backup:** true\n            **SHA256:** ${checksum}\n            \n            Rollback artifacts have been uploaded with 30-day retention.`;\n            \n            await github.rest.issues.createComment({\n              owner: context.repo.owner,\n              repo: context.repo.repo,\n              issue_number: ${{ needs.pre-deployment.outputs.issue-number }},\n              body: commentBody\n            });\n\n  post-deployment:\n    name: post-deployment\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    needs: [pre-deployment, rollback-preparation]\n    \n    steps:\n      - name: Update deployment issue labels\n        uses: actions/github-script@v7\n        with:\n          script: |\n            // Remove in-progress label and add completed label\n            await github.rest.issues.removeLabel({\n              owner: context.repo.owner,\n              repo: context.repo.repo,\n              issue_number: ${{ needs.pre-deployment.outputs.issue-number }},\n              name: 'in-progress'\n            });\n            \n            await github.rest.issues.addLabels({\n              owner: context.repo.owner,\n              repo: context.repo.repo,\n              issue_number: ${{ needs.pre-deployment.outputs.issue-number }},\n              labels: ['completed']\n            });\n      \n      - name: Post final deployment comment\n        uses: actions/github-script@v7\n        with:\n          script: |\n            const artifactName = '${{ needs.rollback-preparation.outputs.artifact-name }}';\n            const checksum = '${{ needs.rollback-preparation.outputs.artifact-checksum }}';\n            \n            const finalComment = `## ðŸŽ‰ Deployment Completed Successfully\n            \n            ### Deployment Summary\n            - Pre-deployment checks: âœ… Passed\n            - Rollback preparation: âœ… Complete\n            - Artifacts created: âœ… Ready\n            \n            ### Rollback Information\n            **Artifact Name:** ${artifactName}\n            **Checksum:** ${checksum}\n            **Retention:** 30 days\n            \n            The deployment has been completed successfully.
