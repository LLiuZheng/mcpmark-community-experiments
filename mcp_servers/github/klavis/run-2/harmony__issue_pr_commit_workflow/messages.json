    "content": "Please execute the following task in my repository mcpmark-eval-zl/harmony:\n\nI need you to implement a complete bug tracking and resolution workflow that demonstrates proper cross-referencing between issues, pull requests, and commits. Here's what you need to do:\n\n**Step 1: Create Issue for Race Condition Bug**\nCreate a new issue with:\n- Title containing: 'race condition', 'HarmonyEncoding', 'concurrent access'\n- Body must include:\n  - A \"## Problem\" heading describing threading issues\n  - A \"## Root Cause\" heading about file locking\n  - A \"## Expected Solution\" heading with bullet points\n  - References to issues #6 and #1\n  - Keywords: \"multiple threads\", \"tokenizer file downloads\", \"mutex-based file locking\"\n\n**Step 2: Create Feature Branch**\nCreate a new branch called 'fix/race-condition-tokenizer-loading' from main.\n\n**Step 3: Implement Thread-Safe Loading**\nOn the feature branch, create/update the file `src/concurrent_loading.rs` with:\n```rust\nuse std::sync::Mutex;\nuse std::sync::OnceLock;\n\n// Thread-safe tokenizer loading with file locks\nstatic DOWNLOAD_MUTEX: OnceLock<Mutex<()>> = OnceLock::new();\n\npub fn load_harmony_encoding_safe(name: &str) -> Result<HarmonyEncoding, HarmonyError> {\n    let _guard = DOWNLOAD_MUTEX.get_or_init(|| Mutex::new(())).lock().unwrap();\n    // Implementation for thread-safe loading\n    // Addresses race condition from issue #6\n    Ok(HarmonyEncoding::new())\n}\n\npub fn load_harmony_encoding_from_file(path: &str) -> Result<HarmonyEncoding, HarmonyError> {\n    // Offline loading API as requested in issue #1\n    HarmonyEncoding::from_file(path)\n}\n```\n\n**Step 4: Create Pull Request with Cross-References**\nCreate a pull request from 'fix/race-condition-tokenizer-loading' to 'main' with:\n- Title containing: 'Fix race condition', 'tokenizer loading', 'threading issues'\n- Body must include:\n  - A \"## Summary\" heading explaining the fix\n  - A \"## Changes\" heading with bullet points about mutex implementation\n  - A \"## Testing\" heading mentioning related issues\n  - \"Closes #[ISSUE_NUMBER]\" pattern linking to your created issue\n  - References to #1 and #6\n  - Keywords: \"thread-safe\", \"concurrent downloads\", \"offline loading API\"\n\n**Step 5: Add PR Review Comments**\nCreate a pending review and add a review comment to the PR with:\n- Technical analysis of the implementation approach\n- Discussion of thread safety mechanisms\n- Keywords that must be included: \"OnceLock\", \"mutex\", \"thread safety\", \"concurrent access\"\n- Reference to issue #1 and the offline loading capability\n- Explanation of how the solution prevents race conditions\nThen submit the review as a COMMENT type review.\n\n**Step 6: Update Issue with Implementation Details**\nAdd a comment to the original issue you created with:\n- Reference to the PR number using \"PR #[NUMBER]\" pattern\n- Technical details about the mutex-based solution\n- Keywords: \"std::sync::Mutex\", \"OnceLock\", \"thread-safe initialization\"\n- Mention of key implementation changes (DOWNLOAD_MUTEX, offline loading)\n- Reference back to issue #1 for offline loading requirement\n\n**Step 7: Close the Issue**\nClose the issue you created by updating its state to 'closed' with state_reason 'completed'.\n\nNote: Based on your understanding, solve the task all at once by yourself, don't ask for my opinions on anything.",
